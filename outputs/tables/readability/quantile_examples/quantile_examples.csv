Dale-Chall Readability,Geography,0.5,"Aims of the Course GCSE Geography offers students the opportunity to study aspects of both the physical and human world and their associated processes. The course aims to make students of Geography effective and independent learners, critical and reflective with enquiring minds. We develop a knowledge and understanding of geographical concepts and the relevance of these concepts to our changing world. We explore the differences and similarities between people’s views of the world, its environments, societies and cultures. We also strive to understand the significance of values and attitudes towards the development and resolution of issues. Our students apply their learning to the real world through fieldwork and other out of classroom activities. Course Content Unit 1: Living with the Physical Environment This unit is concerned with the dynamic nature of physical processes and systems. We also explore the human interaction within them. We develop an understanding of the tectonic, geomorphological, biological and meteorological processes and features in different environments. We then look at the need for management strategies within these and consider the direct and indirect effects of human interaction with the Earth and the atmosphere. ▪ The challenges of natural hazards Earthquakes, Volcanoes, Tropical Storms, Extreme Weather in the UK and Climate Change ▪ The living world Ecosystems, Tropical Rainforest and Hot Environments ▪ Physical landscapes UK Physical Landscapes, Coasts and Rivers Unit 2: Challenges in the Human Environment This unit is concerned with human processes, systems and outcomes and how these change both spatially and temporally. We study a variety of places in varying levels of detail and include places at various stages of development. We develop an understanding of the factors that produce a diverse variety of human environments; the dynamic nature of these environments that change over time and place; the need for sustainable management; and the areas of current and future challenge and opportunity for these environments. ▪ Urban Issues and Challenges Urbanisation, Squatter Settlements, Urban Areas in the UK, Regeneration and Urban Sustainability ▪ The Changing Economic World The Development Gap, Economic Development, Transnational Corporations, Economic Futures in the UK ▪ The challenges of resource management Food, Water, Energy28Shared:Y9 GCSE OPT – 21-23 Unit 3: Geographical Applications The Geographical Applications unit is designed to be synoptic, in that students will be required to draw together knowledge, understanding and skills from the full course of study. It is an opportunity to show breadth of understanding and an evaluative appreciation of the inter relationships between different aspects of geographical study. ▪ Issue evaluation Contemporary geographical issue - A resource booklet is released 12 weeks prior to the exam. Students will develop a critical perspective on the issue(s) studied; consider the points of view of the stakeholders involved, make an appraisal of the advantages and disadvantages, and evaluate the alternatives. ▪ Fieldwork We undertake two compulsory geographical enquiries, in contrasting environments. Students will follow an enquiry process: formulate a hypothesis, collect primary and secondary data, data presentation, data analysis, conclusion and evaluation. Students will undertake a two - day residential fieldtrip during the July of Year 10 to Edale. Here we will complete two pieces of fieldwork; one on the changing characteristics of a river and one on the impact of quarrying on a National Park. This work will be assessed in unit three. ▪ Geographical Skills A wide variety of skills will be developed throughout the course. These are Cartographic, Graphical, Numerical and Statistical skills"

Dale-Chall Readability,Drama,0.5,"What will I be studying? Year 1 Acting: Performing texts Context: Understanding exactly how dialogue and conversation works, how this is reflected in good dramatic writing and how an actor ‘lifts’ such speech ‘off the page’ is important for those wishing to work in the theatre or as performers more widely. The ability to sight read competently and bring dialogue to life is essential for most television, film, radio, voice over and commercial work. Aims: To develop the skills necessary for analysing a piece of dialogue in dramatic writing and to be able to perform it appropriately. To give learners practical experience in these skills, using both modern and classic texts. The purpose of this unit is to enable learners to develop the skills to perform text appropriately. Year 2 Live performance Context: Any aspiring professional performer will need to learn a variety of performance skills to perform in a way that will meet the expectations of their audience and also accurately represent them as performers. Beyond just performing effectively, performers need to think about the other performers, technical crew, performance, equipment, the expectations of the audience, quality and variety in the set and the practice and rehearsal schedule it takes to get to the final performance itself. Regularly having the opportunity to perform in front of an audience can help hone technique, expression and stage presence in order that high quality performance, and the practice required to get there, becomes second nature. Reflecting on performances is also a useful tool – as performers can see themselves through the audience’s eyes and learn more about how to develop their performance style to continually improve and grow in confidence. Aims: The aim of this unit is to give learners the opportunity to explore all the skills required for a live performance. These range from planning, rehearsing and the performance itself to the reflection required post-performance to ensure continual development as performers. By undergoing the process of preparing for a live performance, learners will have the opportunity to experience the variety of activities and skills required to bring a performance together. Year 9 RSL Acting: Careers – Career pathways in performing and directing theatre. Student experience visits from guest speakers and professional practitioners who deliver workshops from a range of cultures and backgrounds.
