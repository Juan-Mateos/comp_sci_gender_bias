## Sentence clusters

To generate boxplots showing the proportion of tokens in each sentence category per subject, run:

```bash
python comp_sci_gender_bias/analysis/sentence_clusters.py
```

This will create individual subject boxplots and the underlying data in `outputs/figures/sentence_clusters/`.
