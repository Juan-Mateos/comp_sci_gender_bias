    This exciting and highly varied course is based upon the challenges and opportunities that the world offers, explored through a range of topics. A blend of human and physical geography helps us to explore the world in which we live, and the connections people and places have.
    
    
    What is the course like and what will be studied
    
    Students will build upon the knowledge and skills developed in Key Stage 3. The course looks at how physical and human environments are linked and how people are affected by geography and continued global change, both in this country, and in other parts of the world.
    
    
    Unit 1 – Living with the physical environment
    
    The physical units develop knowledge of how the physical environment is under constant change, as well as how the environment affects people and how people affect the environment. Topics include; tectonic hazards, weather hazards, ecosystems, hot deserts, tropical rainforests, the changing nature of rivers and coasts and the human interactions with all of the above.
    
    
    Unit 2 – Challenges in the human environment
    
    The human units develop knowledge of the constantly changing man made world as well as what affects these environments developing and consider the factors that make diverse and dynamic environments change over time. As well as the importance of ensuring that building of environments is done in a sustainable way. Topics include; urban issues and challenges, the changing economic world and energy resources and issues.
    
    
    Unit 3 - Geographical Applications
    
    This unit aims to develop geographers as a whole. Fieldwork skills covering both human and physical geography are studied. This includes map skills, describing, analysing and explaining fieldwork data, data recording and statistical analysis. Students are required to complete two compulsory local fieldwork days in preparation for this unit. The second part of this unit is application of knowledge based on understanding gathered throughout the course which is demonstrated through an issue-based evaluation of a set of resources released 12 weeks before the exam.
    
    
    How will the course be assessed
    
    Unit 1: Living with the physical environment (35%) 1 hour and 30 minute exam
    
    Unit 2: Challenges in the human environment (35%) 1 hour and 30 minute exam
    
    Unit 3: Geographical applications (30%) 1 hour and 15 minute exam
    
    
    Future Options
    
    Geography is a very diverse and valued subject both in the world of work and education. Students can progress to A level geography preparing them with the skills they will need for further education such as university.

    Modern geography is so diverse - it is a subject which opens many more doors than it closes. Students who continue
    to study Geography at university can specialise in a huge range of different issues, ranging from volcanology,
    meteorology, oceanography, cartography, development studies, environmental sciences, conservation, urban
    planning, sustainability, demography ... the list goes on!
    What is Geography about?
    At GCSE we cover the most relevant and topical issues affecting our planet. In physical geography you will study into
    the forces that shape the Earth; oceans, and tectonics, whilst in human geography you will learn how our
    relationship with the planet is constantly changing and discover ideas into what the future holds for not only the
    future of the human population but the planet as a whole.
    What pathways does this subject open up after Year 11?
    The vast majority of our students continue to study Geography with us at Bungay Sixth Form. Beyond that, many go
    on to university, some students have gone on to take gap years in conservation projects and aid relief in various
    countries across the globe. Those students going directly into employment will benefit from the transferable skills
    developed within Geography. We have achieved a remarkable level of sustained success in geography at GCSE and A-
    level with results consistently amongst the highest within the country.
    How will you be assessed?
    You will have three exams. Paper 1: Physical Geography 35% (Natural hazards, living world, rivers and coasts), Paper
    2: Human Geography 35% (Urban issues, economic world, resource management), Paper 3: Skills and issue
    evaluation 30% (Including fieldwork).

    nature shaped the earth. You will also study
    how people are affected by the earth and how
    they have changed it, not always for the better.
    Geography as a subject tests more skills than
    any other. Literacy and numeracy skills are
    improved throughout the course. Geography
    also creates ‘analytical thinkers’, ‘report writers’,
    ‘leaders’, people who can react in the field and
    show pragmatism. It truly is a subject which
    encourges a variety of skills.
    How will I be assessed?
    The course taught at GCSE is the new AQA
    Geography GCSE (8035) and is assessed by
    three separate papers:
    Paper 1: Living with the physical environment

    the practical research skills that geographers develop.
    Because geographers learn about human and population development, geography can
    be useful for jobs in charity and international relations too.
    Our Students Say...
    GCSE Geography is a fun and engaging subject that is enjoyed by students who want to
    learn and discover new geographical ideas.
    GCSE Geography is very hard with lots of content to learn. It’s harder than I expected but
    I am glad I chose it because it’s one of my most interesting subjects and it’s engaging!"}
