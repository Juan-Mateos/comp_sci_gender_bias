Drama remains one of the most popular GCSE examination choices in the country, because it is one of the
few subjects which can demonstrate, to employers and university interviewers, a young person’s ability to
work creatively and co-operatively within a group situation, to achieve a common goal. Students learn to
collaborate with others, think analytically and evaluate effectively. They gain the confidence to pursue their
own ideas, reflect and refine their efforts. Whatever the future holds, students of GCSE Drama emerge with
a toolkit of transferable skills, applicable both in further studies and in the workplace. It offers preparation
for students wishing to go on to do ‘A’ Level and degree courses in the Arts and promotes the development
of personal and social skills, of vital importance in the world beyond education.
Aims of the Course
The course is designed to enable students to achieve:
• Increased confidence in personal communication and presentation skills
• The development of creative, cognitive and imaginative abilities
• Greater awareness of themselves as unique individuals and of their role within a group
• A heightened sensitivity to the range of human experience
• Awareness of social, historical and cultural contexts and influences on drama and theatre
• An appreciation of the ways in which playwrights achieve their effects and an ability to
communicate an author’s intentions to an audience, through performance
• Skills in the shaping of dramatic performance
• A recognition of the contribution of design elements in theatre presentation
• An appreciation of the role of theatre in contemporary culture
• Understanding of how to critically evaluate theatre productions
How We Begin
The first 2 terms of the course are spent developing and diversifying students’ understanding of drama,
through participation in practical workshops, exploring such key concepts as narrative structure, tension,
focus and sub-text AND developing their skills in writing analytically about performance. They learn to
work from a script, shape work of their own devising and reflect, in writing, upon their work and that of
others.
Theatre Visits
Attending the theatre to witness different approaches to performance and design, is an ESSENTIAL part of
learning – and assessment – in this subject. In the final examination, students are required to answer
questions on performances they have attended on the course. The Drama Department organises several trips
a year to carefully selected productions outside of Grantham, which are also a basis for work in class.
Additionally, visits to Grantham’s own Guildhall are promoted and students will be expected to attend the
school’s own annual drama production (unless they are appearing in it!)
What is Assessed?
The AQA course presently followed by the department requires students during the course to demonstrate
skills in the crafting of performance, showing awareness of social, historical and cultural influences upon
their work and a recognition of how to work together creatively to develop a drama product. Students are
also required, as part of this coursework, to reflect, in writing, upon those factors which influenced their
practical work.
The final, written examination tests students’ ability to critically evaluate live theatre, which they have
experienced as part of the course, together with their ability to think imaginatively and with sensitivity to22Shared:Y9 GCSE OPT – 21-23
text, as an actor or director in relation to play scripts studied. Students’ understanding of work is assessed
through their ability to express their understanding orally, in writing, and through practical demonstration of
their skills.
The subject content for GCSE Drama is divided into three components- Understanding Drama, Devising
Drama and Texts in Practice.
Practical Assessment (60% of total marks)
The practical assessment is broken up into two components - Devising Drama and Texts in Practice.
In the Devising Drama unit you are exploring the process of creating and performing devised drama as well
as analysing and evaluating your own work. It is assessed through a devising log (60 marks) and a devised
performance (20 marks) and makes up 40% of the GCSE.
The Text in Practice unit requires a performance of two extracts from one play. It is worth 20% of the GCSE
The Terminal Exam 40%
The final exam in Drama consists of a written paper lasting 1 hour and 45 minutes. It is an open book exam
worth 80 marks. The exam assesses students’ knowledge and understanding of drama and theatre including a
study of one set play from a choice of six and an analysis and evaluation of the work of live theatre makers.
Questions
• Section A: multiple choice (4 marks)
• Section B: four questions on a given extract from the set play chosen (44 marks)
• Section C: one two part question (from a choice) on the work of theatre makers in a single live theatre
production (32 marks)
Students are prepared for this through homework, class activities, theatre visits and mock exams during the
course. Failure to participate in theatre visits would place a student on this course at a severe disadvantage
in the final exam","Aims of the Course

Details of coursework components:
Coursework involves learning lines, preparation for performances and the devised work, and the study of a
set text. However, there will be ongoing written practice coursework in preparation for the written exam.
How is ICT used:
Students use the internet to research plays, films and literature in order to prepare both their coursework and
practical work.
Any special requirements:
Students need to understand that they will have to perform on stage in front of live audiences and be able to
work successfully within a team. Excellent attendance is therefore essential. Theatre trips take place
throughout the course to see professional work and exam-based plays. In addition, there may be an
opportunity to attend workshops. There will be costs involved with these.
What the pupils say:
“Year 10 and 11 Drama is very different to KS3. You need the drive to entertain.” “It is fun because you work
with your friends doing something different from other lessons.’ ‘You are able to be more independent, and
work with a like-minded group who also want to do well. You get to learn from a script and perform to a live
audience.","Brief outline of the course:

    This exciting and highly varied course is based upon the challenges and opportunities that the world offers, explored through a range of topics. A blend of human and physical geography helps us to explore the world in which we live, and the connections people and places have.
    
    
    What is the course like and what will be studied
    
    Students will build upon the knowledge and skills developed in Key Stage 3. The course looks at how physical and human environments are linked and how people are affected by geography and continued global change, both in this country, and in other parts of the world.
    
    
    Unit 1 – Living with the physical environment
    
    The physical units develop knowledge of how the physical environment is under constant change, as well as how the environment affects people and how people affect the environment. Topics include; tectonic hazards, weather hazards, ecosystems, hot deserts, tropical rainforests, the changing nature of rivers and coasts and the human interactions with all of the above.
    
    
    Unit 2 – Challenges in the human environment
    
    The human units develop knowledge of the constantly changing man made world as well as what affects these environments developing and consider the factors that make diverse and dynamic environments change over time. As well as the importance of ensuring that building of environments is done in a sustainable way. Topics include; urban issues and challenges, the changing economic world and energy resources and issues.
    
    
    Unit 3 - Geographical Applications
    
    This unit aims to develop geographers as a whole. Fieldwork skills covering both human and physical geography are studied. This includes map skills, describing, analysing and explaining fieldwork data, data recording and statistical analysis. Students are required to complete two compulsory local fieldwork days in preparation for this unit. The second part of this unit is application of knowledge based on understanding gathered throughout the course which is demonstrated through an issue-based evaluation of a set of resources released 12 weeks before the exam.
    
    
    How will the course be assessed
    
    Unit 1: Living with the physical environment (35%) 1 hour and 30 minute exam

Curriculum Support

Technology is ubiquitous in our modern society. Everything from mobile phones, televisions, traffic lights, theme parks, agriculture to sport depend on technology. You need to be prepared for the digital world.

 

The computing syllabus will give you an in-depth understanding of how computer technology works and a look at what goes on ‘behind the scenes’. As part of this, a large amount of the course will be spent learning computer programming. Through this study of computer programming, the course will help you develop critical thinking, analysis and problem solving skills. For many, it will be a fun and interesting way to develop these skills, which can be transferred to other subjects, especially mathematics and other sciences, and even applied in day-to-day life.

It is a fact that information technologies continue to have a growing importance. This means there will be a bigger demand for professionals who are qualified in this area. If you want to go on to higher study and employment in the field of computer science, you will find that this course provides a superb stepping stone. Students who have taken a Computing GCSE and who then progress to study the subject at A Level or university will have a sound underpinning knowledge of this area. We offer Computer Science at both KS4 and KS5. ","Two Specialist spaces for Drama and Theatre Studies, with purpose built raked seating, fully equipped with lighting rigs and sound systems. Break off areas for teaching and learning in theatrical design elements of courses (i.e makeup design, lighting, props and sound). A Dedicated Dance Studio with a sprung wooden floor , mirrors,  visual/ audio equipment  and  resource cupboard Fully resourced Music department, with independent practice rooms and a wide range of instrumental classes available. We go on theatre trips with every exam course to provide applied learning experiences. We have a rich and dynamic extra-curricular programme for all students (i.e. Musical, Drama Club, school productions, Touring Theatre Company and showcases). We have something for everyone. Drama encourages students to develop critical thinking skills, and become effective and independent learners. There is a strong focus on working imaginatively, collaborating creatively and communicating effectively. Students study all aspects of Drama and Theatre studies including devising, directing, and performing through practical and written work.   The departments offers extra curricular opportunities including a weekly drama club leading to involvement in the annual drama showcase (where students can also perform their GCSE and A-Level work), the school musical and theatre trips. The department has educational links to the college and university to provide workshops. GCSE – 100% pass rate for many years. GCSE Drama provides a solid foundation for further Drama studies and vocational opportunities. Students who have study Drama at GCSE have the opportunity to continue to study Drama and Theatre studies as an A level in 6th form.

    • An appreciation of the role that computing and IT plays in the world around them.
    
    • An understanding of the need to practice e-safety when using IT resources, particularly online.
    
    • The role computing and ICT plays in businesses
    
    • To reinforce a cross-curricular approach to computing and ICT - students should encounter both in a wide range of contexts and not exclusively through the study of computing itself
    
    • To emphasise access - Children should have frequent access to ICT tools and have adequate opportunity to use these tools when it is appropriate to do so
    
    The study of computer science, at all key stages, encourages students to develop an appreciation and understanding of the impact that developments in information technology have on themselves, communities worldwide, and the future. It also helps emphasizes the growing importance attributed to the communication aspects of new technologies which students are so keen to engage with nowadays. Consequently, studying computer science and ICT will contribute in a significant way to the general education of pupils, whether or not they intend proceeding to further studies or employment specific to information technology.","At Brimsham Green School, Drama is a highly valued and popular subject across the key stages.

    Geography at GCSE builds on the knowledge, skills and understanding developed in the Lower School. There is no tiered entry; all students sit the same three exams giving them the opportunity to achieve any grade from 1-9.
    
    A wide variety of topics are studied, including climate change, poverty, natural features and processes and sustainable resource use.  There is also a fieldwork element included in the course and a strong focus on developing geographical and analytical skills.
    
    The course consists of three sections within Geography, assessed in three papers.
    
    Geographical skills including map, graph, data and diagram interpretation are assed in all three of the above sections.
    
     
    
     
    
    Assessment Format
    
    AQA (1-9) Geography 8035
    
    Students all follow a linear course which is assessed by three terminal examinations at the end of Year 11. Two of the papers are worth 35% each of the overall qualification, and one is worth 30%. In order to complete Paper 3: Geographical Applications, students will be required to undertake field work, investigating both human and physical environments. Paper 3 also includes a pre-release section for which students receive the information 12 weeks prior to the exam.
    
     
    
    Geography is a subject which relies on a range of skills including observation, investigation, critical thinking, making connections, communication and discussion. Students will develop literacy skills to critically discuss source information, and also numeracy skills in order to create and interpret maps, graphs and data. To succeed in GCSE Geography, students will demonstrate the ability to formulate enquiries, interpret findings and evaluate their own work. The course requires students to become independent learners who have the inclination to extend their own learning beyond the classroom. Geography is concerned with real world and current issues and students will gain awareness of these.
    
    Above all, students will need to be curious about the earth, and be able to apply ideas to new and changing settings."

    Year 1
    
    Acting: Performing texts
    
    Context: Understanding exactly how dialogue and conversation works, how this is reflected in good dramatic writing and how an actor ‘lifts’ such speech ‘off the page’ is important for those wishing to work in the theatre or as performers more widely. The ability to sight read competently and bring dialogue to life is essential for most television, film, radio, voice over and commercial work.
    
    Aims: To develop the skills necessary for analysing a piece of dialogue in dramatic writing and to be able to perform it appropriately.  To give learners practical experience in these skills, using both modern and classic texts.  The purpose of this unit is to enable learners to develop the skills to perform text appropriately.
    
    Year 2
    
    Live performance
    
    Context: Any aspiring professional performer will need to learn a variety of performance skills to perform in a way that will meet the expectations of their audience and also accurately represent them as performers. Beyond just performing effectively, performers need to think about the other performers, technical crew, performance, equipment, the expectations of the audience, quality and variety in the set and the practice and rehearsal schedule it takes to get to the final performance itself. Regularly having the opportunity to perform in front of an audience can help hone technique, expression and stage presence in order that high quality performance, and the practice required to get there, becomes second nature. Reflecting on performances is also a useful tool – as performers can see themselves through the audience’s eyes and learn more about how to develop their performance style to continually improve and grow in confidence.
    
    Aims: The aim of this unit is to give learners the opportunity to explore all the skills required for a live performance. These range from planning, rehearsing and the performance itself to the reflection required post-performance to ensure continual development as performers. By undergoing the process of preparing for a live performance, learners will have the opportunity to experience the variety of activities and skills required to bring a performance together.

    lead to you creating an original piece of theatre and keeping a working portfolio of the process.
    Text Performance will require you to perform two extracts from a published play. The final unit
    will focus on how to bring a play from page to stage, (how you will bring the play to life for an
    audience) as well as reviewing a play that you will watch live at the theatre.
    Will it help me get a job?

    Students will be able to define the term hardware and have an understanding of many different types and how they operate.
    Software
    
    Students will be able to define the term software and have an understanding of the types and how they interact with the user and hardware.
    Representation of data in computer systems
    
    Students will understand how data is stored on a computer system and the different ways they can be represented.
    Databases
    
    Students will be able to understand, operate and create databases.
    Computer communications and networking
    
    Students will learn about the setup and structure of networks and the Internet.
    Programming
    
    Students will gain an understanding of how programming languages operate.
    Unit A452:
    
    Practical Investigation is worth 30% of the overall GCSE grade.
    
    This is a controlled assessment that involves the students carrying out a practical investigation.
    
    This unit is designed to provide candidates with an opportunity to carry out a practical investigation into a computing issue and engage them with computing in the real world.
    
    The unit deliberately extends the candidateís work beyond the topics in Unit A451 in order to provide a stimulating experience.
    
    Candidates will be expected to produce a report which will then be assessed under the four headings:
    
        Practical activity
        Effectiveness and efficiency of the solution
        Technical understanding
        Testing, evaluation, judgements and conclusions

    This unit will require the student to solve a specific problem by writing program code in the python programming language.
    
    Programming tasks set by OCR that enable candidates to design, develop and test a solution to a problem.
    
    OCR will issue a range of practical assessment tasks each consisting of up to three sub-tasks.
    
    Students will need to create suitable algorithms which will provide a solution to the stated problem then code their solutions in a suitable programming language.
    
    The solutions must be tested at each stage to ensure they solve the stated problem using a suitable test plan with appropriate test data. The code must be suitably annotated to describe the process. Test results should be annotated to show how these relate to the code, the test plan and the original problem.
    
    Students will need to provide an evaluation of their solution based on the test evidence.","    GCSE Drama follows the EDUQAS syllabus. The course requires students to work in a group to devise and create an original performance in the style of a theatre practitioner or genre they study in Year 10. The second element of the course requires students to prepare an extract of a published play (again, working in a group), and perform this to a visiting examiner during Year 11. The third and final aspect of the course is to sit a written exam focussing on a set text they have studied and explored practically throughout the two year course,as well as evaluate a live theatre performance they have seen throughout the course.","At KS4 students use the knowledge, understanding and skills they have acquired to help them tackle the rigours of the GCSE course.

    course which suits students who enjoy science and
    have good mathematical ability. Students completing
    this course will be equipped with the logical and
    computational skills necessary to succeed at A Level (or
    equivalent), the workplace or beyond.
    This is a course that has real relevance in our modern
    world. While students will no doubt already have some
    knowledge of computers and related areas, the course
    will give them an in-depth understanding of how
    computer technology works and a look at what goes on
    ‘behind the scenes’.
    As part of this, they will investigate computer
    programming, which many students find interesting.
    Through this study of computer programming, the
    course will help students develop critical thinking,
    analysis and problem-solving skills.
    For many, it will be a fun and interesting way to develop
    these skills, which can be transferred to other subjects
    and even applied in day-to-day life.
    In this way, the course will stimulate interest and
    engagement with technology and technology-related
    careers.","Course outline
    Throughout Year 10 students will work to recall
    some of the skills learnt in KS3 and develop an
    understanding of theatre practice. We will look at
    various practitioners and their work, and begin to use
    some of their theory within practical. Students will
    develop their understanding of Theatre of Cruelty,
    Naturalism, Epic Theatre, Theatre in Education and
    Physical Theatre. Students will have opportunity to
    develop their acting skills, as well as explore puppetry,
    mask work and theatre production. All students will
    be required to act throughout the length of the GCSE,
    and whilst there will be some elements of production
    and design (lighting & sound) this will not form a main
    focus.
    Is Drama for you?
    The course will demand that students are organised
    individuals who understand the requirement to learn
    lines alongside completing set homework tasks. Whilst
    it will not be every week, students will be expected to
    attend rehearsals out of the usual school day as per a
    set timetable as deadlines and examinations approach.
    Students will develop problem solving skills, the ability
    to think on the spot, and challenge their interpersonal
    skills. Opting for Drama will require students to be
    a team player with a want to contribute ideas, lead,
    challenge and develop.","Our GCSE Geography course is written by AQA who
    have a number of excellent resources available;
    including a brand new textbook and a number of
    online resources.
    The course covers a wide range of topics, so students
    should never be bored. Everything from the impacts of
    earthquakes, to the management of cities is covered.
    There is also the opportunity to further develop

    Curriculum Team ","What is included in the course?
    Geography is a popular subject. It teaches you
    to use a variety of skills which are useful in
    other subjects like English, Maths and Science.
    in GCSE Geography you will study the world
    at a range of scales from a local ecosystem up
    to global satellite images. You will look at how
    nature shaped the earth. You will also study
    how people are affected by the earth and how
    they have changed it, not always for the better.
    Geography as a subject tests more skills than
    any other. Literacy and numeracy skills are
    improved throughout the course. Geography
    also creates ‘analytical thinkers’, ‘report writers’,
    ‘leaders’, people who can react in the field and
    show pragmatism. It truly is a subject which
    encourges a variety of skills.
    How will I be assessed?
    The course taught at GCSE is the new AQA
    Geography GCSE (8035) and is assessed by
    three separate papers:
    Paper 1: Living with the physical environment
    (35%)
    Paper 2: Challenges in the human environment
    (35%)
    Paper 3: Geographical applications (30%)
    What grades are available?
    In the Geography course a GCSE qualification is
    available. Grades available are 9 - 1 where 9 is
    the top grade.
    Possible next steps
    This course links well into Post 16. There are
    established A-Levels in Geography which link

    Computer systems Introduces students to the central processing unit (CPU), computer memory and storage, data
    representation, wired and wireless networks, network topologies, system security and system software. It also
    looks at ethical, legal, cultural and environmental concerns associated with computer science. Component 02:
    Computational thinking, algorithms and programming, asks that students apply knowledge and understanding
    gained in component 01. They develop skills and understanding in computational thinking: algorithms,
    programming techniques, producing robust programs, computational logic and translators.
    What’s the difference between Computer Science and IT?
    IT and Computer Science are two distinct subjects, with different aims and objectives. You need to decide
    whether you want to be better at using the computers to achieve a specific design or communication task, in
    which case you would be better suited to IT, or better at the technical elements of computer function and control,
    in which case this is the course for you.
    Do I need a computer at home?
    No – but you will need to be prepared to put in an equal amount of time outside lessons as in class to make sure
    you understand the theory and can apply it in practice. Coursework notes are kept in your own exercise book and
    on a number of online classroom environments so you can refer to your experiences throughout your studies to
    help you learn what you need.
    Can I go on to A Level?
    Yes – this course leads directly into the A Level","If you enjoy Drama, Dance, Musical or Theatrical Theatre, this could be the course for you.

    study physical geography (landforms and natural processes), and one to
    study human geography (interaction of humans and their environment"
http://www.wymondhamhigh.co.uk,"Computer Science is all about learning
    what happens inside computer systems.
    Students will learn about the components
    that make up a computer system, how to
    break problems down into manageable
    chunks, to problem solve, to think
    creatively and innovatively, and program
    a computer system. Students will
    acquire the skills to design, write and test
    computer programmes using Python and
    other programming languages, as well
    as look at the development of computer
    technology and the effects it has had on
    the world around us.
    Course structure
    In Year 9, students learn the fundamental
    concepts of computer coding using
    Python. Students complete different
    assignments that build their programming
    skills and understanding. Students also
    use pseudocode and flow diagrams to
    solve problems, enter local competitions
    for complex scratch gaming and learn to
    program robots.
    In Years 10 and 11 students’ programming
    skills are further developed and they also
    cover the theory behind computing for the
    2 examinations.
    Skills and knowledge you will need
    Computing is a more specialist course than
    ICT and students must have the ability to
    think logically and have a good knowledge
    of mathematics. This course would suit
    students who are targeted at least a
    pathway 6 in Mathematics at GCSE.
    Assessment
    Unit 1 Computer Systems: 50% of the marks (written paper).
    Covers theory on topics including: hardware,
    software, networks, system security,
    communication and ethics in computing.
    Unit 2 Computational Thinking: 50% of the marks (written paper).

    sub programs, testing, translators, binary,
    hexadecimal and compression.
    Progression
    Students who enjoy Computing at GCSE
    can progress to study A Level or other Level
    3 Computing courses. At university there
    is a wide range of computer based degrees
    with options to specialise in areas of
    particular interest.
    There is a serious skills shortage in the
    UK and globally of people who can write
    computer code. There are a wide variety
    of lucrative careers involving computing
    for those with a passion for the subject
    and a willingness to keep learning. In fact,
    the growth and evolution of new technologies
    means in the future there will be lots of jobs
    that require computing skills that we have
    not even thought about yet! Computing is
    a subject that could awaken a passion that
    could lead anywhere and last a lifetime.

    Course structure
    The course is divided into three main areas:
    Devising Theatre: Learners are assessed
    on either acting or design. They participate in
    the creation, development and performance
    of a piece of devised theatre using either
    the techniques of an influential theatre
    practitioner or a genre, in response to a
    stimulus set by the board.
    Learners need to produce the following
    for assessment:
    • A realisation of their piece of devised
    theatre
    • A portfolio of supporting evidence
    • An evaluation of the final performance
    or design
    Performing from a Text: Learners study two
    extracts from the same play and participate
    in a performance using sections from both
    extracts. They will be assessed on acting
    or design.
    Interpreting Theatre: A 90-minute written
    examination.
    Section A:
    Students answer a series of questions on the
    1989 play Hard to Swallow by Mark Wheeler.
    In preparation, learners will explore the text
    practically as a performer, designer and
    director.
    Section B:
    Learners answer one question, from a choice
    of two, requiring analysis and evaluation of
    a given aspect of a live theatre production
    seen during the course.
    Skills and knowledge you will need
    Drama is about creativity, communication
    and cooperation. It is a collaborative art
    form and throughout the course students
    will be required to create work as a team.
    Public performance is a requirement of
    the course, and all students will have an
    assessed performance every term. Drama
    develops your evaluative and analytical
    skills, encourages you to take risks and think
    beyond yourself, exploring a wide variety of
    contexts.

    Geography is a huge part of our lives.
    From choosing our summer holiday
    destination, to deciding what to eat and
    why, to informing our shopping habits, to
    witnessing the dramatic effects of hazards
    such as earthquakes and tsunamis; to
    understanding and acting on climate change
    we are immersed in Geography. Geography
    is ever changing and understanding it vital
    for managing the human and physical
    environment sustainability.
    The geography department’s approach
    to geography is one of discovery. We
    live on an incredible, diverse planet and
    we encourage all our students to ask
    questions that deepen their understanding
    of the physical characteristics of real places
    and how humans interact with these.
    Course structure
    Year 9: This course will help students to
    appreciate differences and similarities
    between places, people and environments.
    Students will develop research, analysis
    and evaluation skills in order to draw and
    justify conclusions.
    Themes:
    • The Ocean: The ocean’s role in the
    functioning of our planet. How are we
    harming the ocean and does it matter?
    Using the ocean more sustainably.
    • USA: The world’s most influential
    super-power.
    • Tourism: What is it? How important is it?
    The pros and cons.
    • Global Fashion: Exploring the clothing
    industry to discover the issues
    surrounding globalisation.
    • China: China’s influence in the world is
    growing – Students need to know about
    China!
    • Our World in 2030: What is our
    ‘ecological footprint?’ What can we do to
    make our eco-footprint more sustainable?
    • The Physical Landscape of the UK:
    Rivers and coasts
    GCSE: This course enables students to
    understand world issues whilst developing
    lifelong skills. Students develop the ability
    to organise, problem solve, interpret data,
    text, maps and images, and to write detailed
    reports justifying decisions — skills that are
    highly valued by employers.
    Themes:
    • Economic Development.
    • Tectonic and Atmospheric Hazards.
    • Environmental Challenges: Ecosystems
    and cold environments.
    • The challenges of Resource Management

    to investigate sustainable management of the
    natural and built environments in this AONB.
    Y10: Students will do a coastal geography
    investigation with fieldwork in Cromer.
    Students build problem solving and team
    work skills, they learn to write geographical
    enquiries based on fieldwork. They learn to
    evaluate different points of view and justify
    their own critical thinking. They learn critical
    thinking and so how to best act sustainably.
    All are critical skills in our changing
    challenging world. Geography builds
    knowledge and skills that employers value,
    but our students value too.

    digital cameras, because these are computers at heart. Computer science teaches you how to use computers to make the
    world work as it does. Computing is of enormous importance to the economy. The growth in the use of mobile devices
    and web-related technologies has led to jobs in these industries and a shortage of skills.
    This qualification will give you an understanding of key computing concepts and programming. Computer science is also
    about people, solving puzzles, creativity, changing the future and, most of all, having fun.
    What could the GCSE lead to?

designer through using different styles, devising strategies, and exploration of
practical texts. They will also be expected to analyse live theatre and theoretically
understand how to write from the perspective of a director and performer.
What will you study?
Whilst studying GCSE Drama students will study many different practitioners
including Stanislavski and Frantic Assembly Theatre Company, whilst also exploring
different styles of theatre, such as physical theatre and musical theatre. Students
will have the choice to complete the course practically as either a performer or
designer (or a combination of both). The different elements of design available are
costume and make-up, set and props, lighting or sound. Drama consists of both
practical and theoretical studies, including regular visits to the theatre, both small
scale productions and the West End. They will be expected to be prepared for
practical lessons by wearing a ‘drama kit’ consisting of plain black top and bottoms
and barefoot. All theory work will be completed in their drama exercise book.
Assessment Methods
Year 10: practical examination (40%): Devise an original performance based on a
stimulus set by the exam board and influenced by a theatre practitioner.
Rehearsed/designed in lessons and with their group at lunchtimes and after school.

Career Ideas/Progression Route:
Drama can be an aid to subjects like English, history or media as it allows students to
immerse themselves into texts in a creative and practical way. Even though it is a highly
practical subject, the theoretically aspect makes up 40% of the subject and allows students
to respond analytically to pieces. It explores confidence in the use of voice and promotes
‘people skills’ that are vital for every world of work including law, medicine, media,
education and business. We have had many students go on to study A level Drama and
Theatre Studies and many successful candidates have gone to acting school and university to
pursue a performance career","Our exam board “OCR B” in GCSE Geography encourages students to ‘think like geographers’ by developing
an enquiry approach to contemporary topics of study. This qualification integrates fieldwork and
geographical skills into the content and assessments giving a holistic approach to the subject. We explore
many key and current questions. For example, how is our population changing? Where shall we build new
homes? How are energy resources being used? How is the global workplace changing? What risk does
flooding pose? What about earthquakes? How can the effects of a disaster be managed?
The world is always changing and this course will give you a chance to learn about those changes.
This is the subject for you if you enjoy:
• learning more about the world we live in in terms of the human and physical geography
• developing skills that will help you in other areas, such as IT and research
• completing some of your own practical work away from the classroom
• working in a team with other students
• learning through investigating and doing, as well as listening and reading
What you will study
The geography department’s key aim is to ensure students are taught engaging geography which is
relevant to them, but manageable in the time available.
Our course will offer a contemporary issues-based approach looking at global and national conflicts and
include a decision making exam based on a topical issue. Fieldwork will be assessed within the exams,
weighted at 15% of the overall GCSE. There will be an emphasis on the geography of the UK, as well as skills
such as how well you understand maps, graphs, applying maths and explaining numeric data. A balance of
physical and human processes and people and environment interactions will be studied. Some of the topics
we will learn include: coasts, resources management, global development, climate change and
globalisation.
