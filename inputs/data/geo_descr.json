The course will give you a chance to get to grips with some of the big questions, which affect our world and understand the social, economic and physical forces and processes, which change and shape our world.  There are so many ways of learning in geography. It is practical, we offer our students the opportunities to learn and develop skills such as GIS, mapping, interpreting data, and role-playing and debating. Geography will help develop literacy skills through report writing and written work and make practical use of numeracy skills when you interpret data and construct graphs. Fieldwork is an important part of our Geography course, we offer at least two opportunities for fieldwork. These are brilliant opportunities to experience some of the things we have learnt about in class.  The subject content is split into four units: 3.1 Living with the physical environment, 3.2 Challenges in the human environment, 3.3 Geographical applications and 3.4 Geographical skills.  In units 3.1 and 3.2 the content is split into sections, with each section focusing on a particular geographical theme. Unit 3.3 sets out the requirements for fieldwork and issue evaluation. Unit 3.4 sets out the geographical skills that students are required to develop and demonstrate.  In the specification content, students are required to study case studies and examples. Case studies are broader in context and require greater breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding. Examples are more focused on a specific event or situation, are smaller in scale and do not cover the same degree of content.  How will I be assessed? You will have three written exams. Papers 1, 2 are 1 hour 30 minutes long and together, they contribute 70% of your final written mark.

  "162": "Geography is a popular subject at GCSE, AS and A2 level with many students opting to pursue a University course based on a Geographical subject specialism. The drive behind the geography curriculum is to provide students with knowledge of the world around them and teach them the skills they need to understand the processes that affect their environment. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics that are equally balanced between human and physical geography and includes case studies from many different countries.  The result is that the curriculum appeals to all students at Bishop Douglass School. Students will be expected to understand geographical events and processes at a variety of scales, evaluate the causes and impacts and appreciate the interdependence between people and places. By doing so, they have a firm understanding of the processes and events that affect the environment that we live in and they are able to apply their understanding to understand and interpret other geographical events and processes.   The department benefits from two passionate teachers who each bring their own fields of expertise to the planning of lessons and the knowledge that can be shared with students. The two teachers have developed specialist knowledge in human and physical geography to complement each other.

  "284": "Our vision and philosophy Geography is, in its simplest form, a desire for humankind to interact, describe and understand the world around us. As the world shifts and evolves at an increasing pace so too must its inhabitants. It is therefore the intention of our Geography curriculum to inspire and inform young global citizens. In service of equipping our students with the knowledge and skills to encounter and experience our diverse planet, we have incorporated the themes of globalisation, sustainability, and a sense of place. Our curriculum aims to create a sense of place outside of everyday lived experience. This is central to the study of Geography and is created through understanding the relationship between physical processes and human interactions. These geographical concepts will allow our students to be introduced to geopolitical powers such as the conflict of the Gaza Strip, the disappearing islands of Kiribati and the interdependence of nations. We pride ourselves on introducing our students to the traditions of geographical academia grounded in exploration and fieldwork. Fieldwork will allow a first-hand experience of geomorphic processes and an opportunity to explore perception and place. Through studying Geography at HAOC students will have a fundamental understanding of the world around them. They will be informed citizens of the planet who have learnt about space and place outside of their lived experience. They will be ambassadors for sustainable living and have a geopolitical understanding promoting tolerance, mutual respect and democracy. This cultural capital will make our geographers will be academically successful and well-informed with powerful knowledge, empowering them to achieve.   KS4 Year 10 Students will begin their geographical journey in KS4 by building on their prior knowledge of plate tectonics through the study of Global Hazards here we will consolidate learning and introduce more the more complex concepts of hot spot volcanoes and convection currents. Students will have been introduced to a number of biomes throughout KS3 this is studied as a discrete unit of work Sustaining Ecosystems in Year 10. Students will focus on Polar and Rainforest Biomes which will have been studied at KS2 and KS3 previously. Here we build on prior knowledge and establish why and how these biomes are located across different regions. Students also continue their work on sustainability by looking at both regional and global responses to climate change. Students then study the UK in the 21st Century followed by Distinctive Landscapes, this will be revisiting and building on concepts introduced within the KS3 topics of the UK, Rivers and Coasts. Students will be introduced to more complex theories such as the Demographic Transition Model and the Bradshaw Model when considering these topics in greater depth. Students will examine how real-world processes can be understood through theoretical models. Here students will complete fieldwork of a river and an urban area. Here we will introduce similarly complex methods of statistical analysis, data collection and presentation.  Year 11 In Changing Climate, we consider the impact on climate change on the UK having previously studied Kiribati and China. Students will evaluate the qualitative and quantitative evidence of out changing climate. Students then draw on prior knowledge during the topic of Urban Futures. This builds on concepts of urbanisation introduced in Year 8 during the China topic and explores London as a city which was first introduced in Year 7. Students will contrast the urbanisation of Lagos to that of London using qualitative and quantitative data analysis. This leads to the following topic on Resource Reliance where students are re-introduced to the ideas of supply and demand and its impact on food and water security.   At the conclusion of their five-year geography curriculum students will be keen lifelong geographers with a strong sense of place through studying a myriad of regions and nations in juxtaposition to the UK. They will have mastered the concepts of human and physical geographies and will have a concrete understanding of their interactions. Students will have a clear understanding of climate change and sustainability and will have contextualised this knowledge across the globe at a variety of scales. Students will be critical thinkers confident in dispelling misconceptions around development, climate and geographical theory. Students will have mastered fundamental map and graph skills and can use these with confidence. Students have a clear understanding of fieldwork its practice and limitations, they have completed fieldwork in a variety of locations and completed competent data analysis and presentation. Our students will be academically successful and informed global citizens. They will be advocates of a democratic and sustainable world and will have the qualifications to enable them to be successful members of society.",
  "292": "Geography Key Stage 4 What can students do to develop their skills in this subject area?  Attend after Academy revision sessions. Do additional research about the case studies provided in the revision guide. Create a revision guide for the unit of work that they are studying. Create a glossary of new vocabulary that they acquire during Geography lessons. Take a lead role in teaching key concepts and ideas to others during lessons. Try to make links to between geographical theory and ideas and places that they have studied. Ask teachers for access to past exam papers/sample questions and answers. Read and use maps when visiting places. Watch the news and keep up to date with current events and their link to Geography. Enhance maths skills that link to Geography by applying ideas from maths lessons and putting them into a Geographical context.  What wider reading can be completed to support the curriculum? Students could read and critically evaluate the presentation of Geography within any national newspapers. Students could keep a 'Geography in the news' scrapbook \u2013 printing off or cutting out any stories they hear about that are related to Geography. Equally, on holiday, they could similar scrapbook about the human and physical environment of the place. The following texts may be of interest: Reading the Horrible Geographies series. AQA textbooks and revision guides. Atlases Encyclopaedias/country fact file books.  What websites could students visit to support the curriculum? www.nhm.ac.uk www.rgs.org www.ready.gov/volcanoes www.fema.gov www.usgs.gov www.metoffice.gov.uk www.environment-agency.gov.uk www.100people.org www.oxfam.org.uk www.cia.gov www.nhc.noaa.gov www.earth.google.co.uk www.earthfromtheair.com ww2.defra.gov.uk www.gapminder.org www.coolgeography.co.uk www.aqa.org.uk www.cia.gov www.geographypods.com www.youtube.com - YouTube account for Mr Parr for Geographical songs.  Can television and film assist with supporting the curriculum? Certain television programmes can be useful: Planet Earth (BBC). Coast series (BBC2). Kevin Mcleod Slumming it (Channel 4). Search Dr Iain Stewart in YouTube for tectonics and processes. An Inconvenient Truth (Climate Change). Various BBC documentaries by Simon Reeve, covering both physical and human geographical themes. Watch the news for stories with a geographical connection. Countryfile. Watching films such as: The Impossible. The Day After Tomorrow. 2012. San Andreas. Slumdog Millionaire. Flood. Dante's Peak.  How can parents/carers help and what can be done at home? Discuss and debate current affairs, particularly issues related directly to Geography, e.g. EU referendum, geopolitical debates. Discuss geographical events/festivals that are taking place, e.g. music festivals, carnivals, sporting events. Encourage students to explain their own views on a range of geographical issues, but also encourage them to reflect on why others may not share these views. Support students with additional knowledge linked to homework (i.e. what you know, your opinion, how things have changed?) Encourage students to use road maps when planning a journey rather than a satellite navigation system. Visit places of Geographical interest, either locally (e.g. Lincolnshire Wolds, Hubbard's Hills, Rimac Saltmarsh, Hull) or further afield (e.g. Dorset coastline, The Eden Project, Brimham Rocks, London, Leeds, etc.). When on holiday, take note of human and physical environments such as coastal processes, cultural behaviour and transport systems). Look for evidence of Geography where you might not expect to find it, e.g. sporting rivalries, museums, adverts, music and art. Find out about or join a conservation organisation, e.g. WWF, Woodland Trust, Surfers Against Sewage.",

  "299": "GCSE GEOGRAPHY  Achievement Leader: Mr R G Dowd   What is Geography? Geography is about understanding the world\u2019s people, places and environments.  It illuminates the past, explains the present and prepares us for the future.  What can be more important than that?  Geography is one of the most popular option choices at GCSE with over a third of students in England taking the subject.  Geography is not only up-to-date and relevant, it is one of the most exciting, adventurous and valuable subjects to study at GCSE level.  So important, in fact, that the Guardian newspaper in 2015 named Geography as a \u2018must-have GCSE and A-Level\u2019 to help you make sense of the world.  If you are not sure about what you want to do in the future, Geography helps to keep your options open.  It is a subject that goes well with the Sciences and Mathematics as well as the Humanities, Languages and Arts.  It is very flexible in terms of what it can be combined with both at GCSE and A Level.  What skills will I develop? Almost too many to mention!  There are so many ways of learning in Geography.  It is very practical with opportunities to learn new skills such as modern computer based mapping (called GIS), digital technologies, map skills, interpreting photographs, analysing articles, decision-making and debating. Fieldwork and trips are a really important part of Geography.  You will learn how to investigate issues in the real world.  You will improve your literacy through your report writing and written work and you will also learn how to put forward your own point of view and convince others that you are right! You will make practical use of your numeracy skills when you interpret data and construct graphs.  Your memory skills will also be boosted as you learn key memory techniques to help you remember case study information (facts and figures about places).  Such a wide variety of skills gained in Geography will be useful to you after you leave school.  These skills are highly sought after by sixth form colleges, universities and employers.  What syllabus will I follow? AQA GCSE Geography (8035)  What will the course look like? The course is split into three sections: Unit 1 \u2013 Living with the Physical Environment Natural Hazards, Ecosystems including Rainforests & Extreme Environments, and Coasts & Rivers Unit 2 \u2013 Challenges in the Human Environment Urban Issues and Challenges including a study of Bristol and Rio de Janeiro, Changing Economic World, Natural Resources Unit 3 \u2013 Geographical Applications Fieldwork and an Issue Evaluation, which contains a decision making exercise based on a pre-release resources booklet made available 12 weeks before the Unit 3 exam.  Fieldwork and Trips As part of the course, you will take part in two pieces of fieldwork which will allow you to investigate different geographical issues.    Fieldwork for Unit 1 will be an investigation into coastal processes and management on the Holderness Coast  Fieldwork for Unit 2 will be in Bradford City Centre, with a focus on Broadway and Kirkgate shopping centres.  What homework will I get? Homework is set every week with a range of activities and challenges including reading, research, note-taking and practice examination questions.  How will I be assessed? There are three examinations at the end of Year 11: -\tUnit 1 (1hr 30mins) tests Physical Geography (3 topics) -\tUnit 2 (1hr 30mins) tests Human Geography (3 topics) -\tUnit 3 (1hr 15mins) tests Fieldwork and contains a Decision Making Exercise  What jobs or further courses of study might this lead to? Students who have studied Geography have gone on to work in the following sectors: law, science, sales, business, environment, information technology, management, finance, banking, marketing, research, manufacturing, teaching, childcare, engineering and building, arts, design and media, town planning, working abroad and many (many) more\u2026  Are there any entry requirements for this course?

Geography stimulates an interest in and a sense of wonder about places. It explains how places and landscapes are formed, how people and environment interact and how a diverse range of economies and societies are interconnected. It builds on students\u2019 own experiences to investigate the personal to the global. Geographical enquiry encourages questioning, investigation and critical thinking about issues affecting the world and people\u2019s lives, for the present and future. Fieldwork is an essential element of this. Students will learn to think spatially using maps, visual images and new technologies including geographical information systems, to obtain, present and analyse information. Geography inspires students to think about their own place in the world, their values and responsibilities to other people, to the environment and the sustainability of the planet. There are a number of key concepts that underpin the study of geography, which students need to deepen and broaden their knowledge, skills and understanding. These concepts are: \u2022 Place \u2022 Space \u2022 Scale \u2022 Interdependence \u2022 Process (human and physical) \u2022 Cultural Diversity  COURSE DESCRIPTION UNITS/MODULES Students start the GCSE Edexcel B geography course in year 9 and study the content and skills over 3 years.

Geography, therefore, has important links to citizenship \u2013 we are all global citizens, with responsibilities to the planet and to each other.  Aims To stimulate an interest in, and understanding of, the natural and human worlds To develop the skills, knowledge, and understanding necessary to engage with the world To develop an understanding of interdependence \u2013 how actions in one part of the world affects others  How to Improve Read the teacher comments on your work and where relevant act on them. Listen actively in lessons and fully engage in all class activities. Ask questions when you do not understand something. Act on the targets you are set and review targets from previous assessments. At Key Stage 4 and 5 look closely at exam board mark schemes, moderator reports, and exemplar answers.  Ensure your answers are following the structure assessments laid out in the mark schemes and address the command word in questions. At KS4 and 5, use the text book to read ahead to be ready for new topics. Review your work frequently. Make revision materials as you progress through units of work.  Test yourself on these regularly. At KS4 and 5, use the text book to consolidate classroom learning. Watch the news, read a newspaper, and make links to topics you are studying. Read widely using resources in the library and on the internet. Explain your lessons to your parents.  How can parents help: Geography is a popular television topic.  Encourage your daughter to watch programmes such as those by David Attenborough, or current affairs documentaries like Many of the BBC Science programmes also cover geographical issues, especially topics such as volcanoes and earthquakes and weather and climate The single most important thing that will improve geographical understanding is an understanding of global affairs.  Read a newspaper or watch the news with your daughter to engage her with local and global issues. Talk to your daughter about climate change and encourage her to get involved in the school climate change movement. Natural History Museum, London has excellent displays of geological history and tectonic activity. Turn off the satnav and navigate by map.

Pupils will gain a deeper understanding of the processes that lead to geographical changes and the multivariate nature of human physical relationships and interactions, with a stronger focus on forming valid generalisations and abstractions, together with a growing awareness of the importance of theoretical perspectives and conceptual frameworks in geography. Running parallel to this, pupils will be able to plan and undertake independent enquiry in which skills, knowledge and understanding are applied to investigate geographical questions. The intention is to continue to stimulate the boys to think even more deeply about their place in the world, their values and their rights and responsibilities to other people and the environment.   Geography has an important role to play with regard to cultural capital. Cultural capital is the accumulation of knowledge, behaviours and skills that a pupil can draw upon to demonstrate their cultural awareness, knowledge and competence. The curriculum is designed to inspire a curiosity and fascination about the world and its people as well as equipping them with knowledge about diverse places, people, resources and natural/human environments. In the summer term of year 10, pupils explore river processes and pressures in a visit to Cardingmill Valley, Shropshire.

  "4": "Who to ask about this subject: Ms XX, or your Geography teacher. Qualification: GCSE Geography Examination Board: EdExcel  This course is about learning more about the world in which we live. Geographers ask the questions why and how processes happen, and how these changes impact on the landscapes we see around us. We are also interested in how humans have shaped the world and the future impacts of this. Geography is about understanding our own place in the world and the factors which have led to the changing world around us. Issues such as globalisation, climate change and environmental damage have made Geography extremely relevant to all people in the twenty first century. The department prides itself in the level of support offered to students and the quality of teaching and learning within Geography lessons. We believe that Geography is a \u2018field science\u2019 and offer a range of opportunities for learning beyond the classroom. We offer a field trip to the East Yorkshire coast during Year 10 to collect data that is used for the fieldwork exam we also collect qualitative data to improve our Human Geography skills and to see the interactions between the physical environment and human activity What you will study We follow the Edexcel A GCSE Geography course looking at the following topics. Physical Geography \u2013 We study our ever changing natural environment by looking at geology, coastal landscapes and river studies. We also look at hazards in more depth through the studies of hurricanes and extreme environments. We finish this unit by studying ecosystems, especially the challenge of tropical rainforests and hot environments. Human Geography \u2013 The way in which humans interact with each other and the landscape is studied through urban issues and the economic challenges of living in a developing world. We look at the challenges of living in the modern world by studying resource management and food issues across the world. We also look at Geographical skills such as maps, graphs and enquiries to help us get a better understanding of the world. Finally, we look at a contemporary issue and evaluate different strategies to manage this.

The study of both physical and human geography empowers students with the knowledge and understanding to investigate the world around them.  Key Stage 4 GCSE Geography provides students with an integrated and in-depth knowledge and understanding of why the world is the way it is and the interconnections between people, places and environments over differing geographical and temporal scales.  It encompasses a broad range of topics, such as climate change, natural hazards, shifts in economic power, ecosystems, urbanisation, physical landscapes and the sustainable use of resources such as food, energy and water.  Within these topics, we explore case studies at a variety of scales and in countries with differing levels of development.   In terms of skills, students will experience fieldwork where they are encouraged to ask geographical questions; plan enquiries; collect, present, interpret, analyse and evaluate information from a variety of sources; and suggest further ideas for geographical enquiry.  Geography also develops a wide range of general skills and capabilities that can be applied in everyday life, for example, decision-making; empathy; ICT; communication; an appreciation and respect for social, cultural and religious diversity; teamwork; creativity; and critical thinking.",

The subject extends students\u2019 interest and knowledge beyond their immediate experiences, using images and information to help them interpret about people and concepts that they acquire from media, internet and textbooks. Geography develops major skill areas: Map and fieldwork skills; cross-curricular skills such as ICT, Literacy and Numeracy; as well as an increasing awareness of the world around us and the idea of sustainability. We want students to become global citizens and show a keen awareness of the geography around them. Geography is everywhere and students at Settlebeck develop a keen awareness and appreciation of the geography around them.  Geography is a sprawling, hybrid discipline that spans both the natural and social sciences. Geography provides students with new ways of thinking about the world using \u2018big ideas\u2019 such as Place, Space and Interconnection. Geography Provides students with powerful ways of analysing, explaining and understanding the world. Further, geography gives students power over their own knowledge- students need to know about the discipline and how knowledge has been developed and tested. Geography enables students to follow and participate in debates in significant local, national and global issues and takes students beyond their own local environment allowing them to become global citizens.  We study Geography because it is a multi-faceted discipline that combines the analysis of social questions, environmental issues, and modern real-world solutions. Geographers investigate interactions between the human and physical environments such as the causes and impacts of climate change or the development gap. We equip learners with empathy of other cultures and the variety of local, national and global issues and their solutions through the study of real-world examples as well as using practical fieldwork, investigatory skills and research skills.",

  "176": "Curriculum Principles At Dixons Unity, we are united behind the common purpose of empowering young people from all cultures and backgrounds to improve their life chances and develop a lifelong love of learning which enriches the local community. Our curriculum is designed and delivered to work towards achieving this aim. By the end of their journey through Dixons Unity Academy, a student in Geography will: Understand a wide range of geographical concepts, analyse social questions, environmental issues and real-world solutions. Develop a sense of place to help them interpret the world and to understand the complex interaction between human and physical processes on the planet. Students will learn about places that are outside of their own experience, they will develop their understanding of the world\u2019s diversity of environments, peoples, cultures and economies. Students will develop a global \u2018open mindedness\u2019 so that they can challenge stereotypes and contribute to the development of key ideas and concepts. Our uniting sentence is: The Geography department provided students with a deep understanding and sense of awe at the complex human and physical interactions that have shaped and continue to shape the planet. The department gave students the confidence to take action to mitigate the problems of the present for the benefit of future generations. In order to truly appreciate the subject and develop a deep schema, Geography has been sequenced with the following rationale: We aim to provide students with the ability to access the powerful knowledge that will enable students to think about the world from an informed position and provide solutions to some of the problems the world faces. We aim to: Provide students with powerful ways of analysing, explaining and understanding the world and for students to engage in debates about important issues at local, national and global levels. Geography takes students beyond their own experience. This knowledge of the world contributes strongly to students\u2019 general knowledge. We believe that both substantive knowledge (geography facts) and procedural knowledge (skills and processes) are both essential in the study of Geography. At KS3 it is assumed that students will not have experienced discrete geography lessons in primary school and therefore will arrive at Dixons Unity with a limited knowledge of the world. As a result, KS3 will address basic geographical skills including how to use an atlas, map skills (direction, distance and scale) and using grid references on Ordnance Survey maps. Students will start to develop their knowledge of major global, regional and local landmarks, countries and physical features through regular practice in the form of map and atlas activities. This content will be spaced throughout Year 7 and 8 so knowledge will be embedded for a large majority of students by the time they begin GCSE Geography. Students studying Geography in Year 7 and 8 will begin to identify synoptic links between topics, such as the link between overpopulation and habitat loss, or climate change. Lessons will address common misconceptions and stereotypes, for example by ensuring that students are aware of the rapid economic development in the African continent through the \u2018What is it really like in Africa?\u2019 topic in Dynamic Countries. Specialist Geography students follow the AQA GCSE curriculum from Year 9. Although we work towards giving our students the best possible opportunities in life through success at GCSE, our curriculum goes beyond what is examinable. With the awareness that this may be the last formal education of geography, we want students to leave with all essential and necessary geographical skills needed for future education, employment and global citizenship. We encourage debate and discussion of key ideas, written and analytical skills through \u2018to what extent\u2019 questions at GCSE and issue evaluation in non-specialist and KS3 courses. Throughout the five-year plan we build on analytical and critical thinking skills using a range of data sets and infographics (NC), with the most in-depth exploration of the enquiry sequence being through the GCSE fieldtrip. Non-Specialist Geography students will study places in greater depth throughout Year 9 (India, China and Africa) and will be encouraged to develop clear opinions on key geographical issues such as climate change and \u2018Should roads be built through Tropical Rainforests?\u2019 Students will develop knowledge that will enhance their role as global citizens. Our Geography curriculum addresses Social Disadvantage through:  Keeping aspiration on track by encouraging students to understand their role as a global citizen, for example by making informed choices on what they buy through an awareness of fast fashion and food miles  Introducing a range of country examples in lessons that develop a breadth of knowledge of physical and human phenomena across the world  Teaching students how to think, speak and write like a geographer to develop oracy and quality of written communication. These skills, along with key geographical skills, provide our students with the building blocks to understand key discussion in the discipline.  Our curriculum is inspired by and linked to the newest thinking in geography through reference and inspiration from books and research, such as Factfulness (Hans Rosling), Poverty Safari (Darren McGarvey) and The Almighty Dollar (Dharshini David).  Of course, we engage our students in global issues, but also inspire them to think about much more local and high impact issues particularly to our student demographic, such as urban change and social/economic/environmental disparities. (this needs rewording, but do you know what I mean? Trying to get across that some topics are very relevant to our students)  Providing opportunities to develop powerful geographical knowledge, such as development, changing landscapes and the resource crisis, delivered through schemes of work  Increasing the number of cultural experiences and fieldtrip opportunities to inspire awe and wonder, for example to Malham Cove in the Yorkshire Dales National Park.  We are highly ambitious for our students and encourage all students to choose to continue their study of Geography at GCSE, A Level and at Degree level, as we hope to inspire a love and joy of learning about the dynamic world around them, and their place within it. Our curriculum in Geography supports the personal development of students by: Students will learn about different cultures and about difficult contemporary challenges of climate change, the development gap, the impact of globalisation and sustainability. Geography is a naturally powerful and transformative discipline; students learn to understand the world around them, which transforms the way they see it. This enables our students to confidently approach life after school whether that be in social situations, employment or further study. We aim for our students to be empowered by the ability to critique and analyse data, news, media and literature. Our geography curriculum supports the personal development of students by giving them such an understanding of the ever-changing world, societies and economies that they can confidently debate and fact find in a world where \u2018fake news\u2019 and social media are often taken as truth. A powerful and balanced provision of both physical geography and human geography enables students to draw links between the two sub-disciplines and provides them with a rich knowledge of the deeply connected physical and human world. Throughout the 5 years students are encouraged to speak like geographers by consistently discussing environmental, social and economic approaches; soon seeing that not one of the three come without impacts on the other two. By the end of our curriculum, whether that be the end of year 9 or 11, we aim to have secured their curiosity and fascination (NS) about the world through inspiring awe and wonder with a focus on developing wellinformed, naturally critical and analytical way of thinking. Our belief is that homework should consist of purposeful and deliberate practice and interleaved revision of what is taught in lessons. This knowledge is secured and applied through metacognitive quizzing and low-stakes tests Homework is based on the use of Knowledge Organisers and low stakes quizzing. The Learn Now will quiz students on content from the previous lesson, the previous cycle and the previous year so that there is interleaving and a major focus on retrieval practice. Opportunities are built into the curriculum to make links to the world of work in support of our careers advice and guidance that all students receive: Geography is a recognized academic subject respected by universities and employers. Geography graduates are employed in occupations as diverse as marketing, advertising, law, sales, finance, education, environmental awareness, civil service, the Foreign Office, the travel industry and journalism. Throughout the five years we discuss careers in geography, this is seen on the lesson slides, this supports our students in seeing geography outside of the classroom and into their future. The world of work that our students will face will have to revolve around a better understanding of the environment, more so than any generation before; throughout the curriculum we dive into topical issues that are only going to become more prominent in industry such as renewable energy, climate change, changing economies, resource management and quaternary sector business. Opportunities to build an understanding of the social, moral, spiritual and ethical issues are explored through:  Studying geography will stimulate curiosity, interest and enjoyment in Geography and empower students to reflect and act on the challenging issues of our world including climate change, overpopulation and globalisation. Students will be encouraged to consider the moral issues surrounding climate change (individual responsibility, causes and solutions, being a sustainable citizen).  We will aim to inspire students to take a proactive approach to learning outside of lessons and help them to understand that geography is everywhere and its relevance to their everyday life. (2 x fieldwork, independent learning tasks, discussions around the media and geography in the news,  We will encourage students to understand their role in society by considering different viewpoints, values and attitudes that are different from their own. For example, issue evaluation topics throughout, such as developing the rainforest (Y9NSP), building on greenbelt land (GCSE YR10) or using gapminder.com to assess disparities in lifestyles, require an absence of ignorance to understand different and opposing viewpoints in order to make informed decisions.  We will invite guest speakers, such as Geography Ambassadors trained by the Royal Geographical Society, to introduce students to the benefits of studying geography, widening their perception of the subject and encouraging them to pursue geography beyond Year 8.  We will support students in their moral and spiritual development, and actively promote fundamental British values throughout the Geography curriculum including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance. Through KS3 and 4 students study case studies including Africa, China and India (NC) extending and updating their locational and place knowledge as well as understanding similarities and differences (comparing being a key command word used in GCSE in particular) between places and systems. (NC)  We will promote British values and spiritual, moral, social and cultural development (SMSC). The main link between British values and Geography is through the promotion of \u2018tolerance and harmony between different cultural traditions by enabling students to acquire an appreciation of and respect for their own and other cultures\u2019. Students will be exposed to a range of cultures through case study examples and online videos from both developed and developing countries. Topics such as climate change, resource management, and studies of varying levels of development enable our students to assess the world in its entirety, to see past political borders, develop a sense of place and appreciate the world\u2019s current issues as a global responsibility",

The course will give you the chance to get to grips with some of the big questions which affect our world and understand the social, economic and physical forces which shape and change our world. Geography looks at the world today and the impacts humans are having on the future of the planet. We investigate the physical processes and factors that produce diverse and dynamic landscapes over time and the issues that concern us in the human environment such as population and development. It is a solid academic subject and well respected by universities and employers alike. Paper 1: Living with the physical environment You will study topics such as \u2018The challenge of natural hazards\u2019, \u2018The living world\u2019 and \u2018Physical landscapes in the UK\u2019. Geographical skills are included throughout and involves a field visit with both a human centred focus and a physical centred focus. Paper 2: Challenges in the human environment This paper focuses on the human elements of Geography and will cover topics such as \u2018Urban issues and challenges\u2019, \u2018The changing economic world\u2019 and \u2018The challenge of resource management\u2019. Geographical skills are also included reflecting on the human Environment. Paper 3: Geographical application This paper will ask questions of the field visits you conducted and focus on data collection methods, analysis and evaluations. The skills will also cover data presentation and interpretation.

  "15": "In Year 9, you have already started studying GCSE Geography and starting to develop the examination skills required to be successful. The subject bridges the gap between the sciences and the arts and covers contemporary global issues; having an understanding of these will become very important in your future life. The GCSE Geography qualification is a linear course with all examinations sat at the end of the course (Year 11). The new specification contains a unit 1 exam based on the physical environment, a unit 2 exam based on the human environment and unit 3 exam based on issue evaluation and fieldwork. The subject content is split into four units: 3.1 Living with the physical environment, 3.2 Challenge in the human environment, 3.3. Geographical applications and 3.4 Geographical skills. In units 3.1 and 3.2 the content is split into sections, with each section focusing on a particular geographical theme. Unit 3.3 sets out the requirements for fieldwork and issue evaluation. Unit 3.4 sets out the geographical skills that students are required to develop and Demonstrate.  GCSE breakdown Unit 1: Living with the physical environment - Section A: The challenge of natural hazards - Tectonic hazards, Tropical storms, Extreme weather in the UK, Climate change. Section B: Physical landscapes in the UK - UK physical landscapes, River landscapes in the UK, Glacial landscapes in the UK. Section C: The living world \u2013 Ecosystems & Tropical rainforests, Hot deserts. Unit 2: Challenges in the human environment - Urban issues and challenges, the changing economic world and the challenge of resource management. Unit 3: Geographical applications - Issue evaluation - Synopticity, critical thinking and problem-solving. Fieldwork - Questions based on the use of fieldwork in an unfamiliar context and questions based on students\u2019 individual enquiry work. 3.1 Living with the physical environment This unit is concerned with the physical processes and systems, their dynamic nature and human interaction with them at a range of scales and in a range of places.  The aims of this unit are to develop an understanding of the processes and forms associated with tectonic, geomorphological, biological and meteorological processes in different environments, and the need for management strategies governed by sustainability and consideration of the direct and indirect effects of human interaction with the earth and Atmosphere. 3.2 Challenges in the human environment This unit is concerned with human processes, systems and outcomes and how these change both spatially and temporally. They are studied in a range of places, at a variety of scales and must include places in various states of development. The aims of this unit are to develop an understanding of the factors that produce a diverse variety of human environments; the dynamic nature of these environments that change over time and place; the need for sustainable management; and the areas of current and future challenge and opportunity for these environments. 3.3 Geographical applications This unit is designed to have elements of synopticity. It is an opportunity for students to show their breadth of understanding and appreciation of the inter-relationships between different aspects of geographical study.  Issue evaluation \u2013 This section contributes a critical thinking and problem-solving element to the assessment structure. It provides students with the opportunity to demonstrate geographical skills and applied knowledge and understanding by looking at a particular issue(s) derived from the specification using secondary sources. The issue(s) will arise from any aspect of the subject content but may extend beyond it through the use of resources. They can then analyse a geographical issue at a range of scales, consider and select proposed solutions and justify their choices. Fieldwork \u2013 Students will need to undertake two geographical enquiries. The first fieldwork enquiry will be based upon the content in unit 3.1.2 (River landscapes in the UK). This will be carried out in Year 10. The second fieldwork enquiry will take place in Year 11 and will be based upon the regeneration in a local urban area.",

  "197": "\u201cGeography is the subject which holds the key to our future.\u201d Michael Palin Why study Geography? Geography is an incredibly diverse, stimulating, exciting and relevant subject to study. Its breadth is one of the aspects of the subject which appeals most to students; there is something for everyone, it\u2019s never out-of-date and it\u2019s all around us, all of the time. While geographers study a huge range of topics, from population change to volcanic eruptions, everything is linked to people and places in the world today. Geographers develop not only an excellent general knowledge of countries, environments and cultures but are aware of contemporary conflicts and challenges which can be global in scale or more local. Geography is very much an enquiry-based subject; we are always asking questions about the world and encourage students to investigate places and issues that spark their interest. For instance, we will consider: \u2713 Is the Yellowstone supervolcano a threat to mankind? \u2713 What factors have made Honduras one of the most crime-ridden and dangerous countries in the world? \u2713 Should countries develop their nuclear energy supplies or focus on greener renewable energy instead? \u2713 Why are Egypt and Ethiopia locked in a conflict over the ownership of the Nile\u2019s water resources? \u2713 Having reached 7.8 billion people in 2020, will the world population keep growing at the same rate? \u2713 What will the world look like in 100 years if climate change continues? \u2713 How has Qatar become the richest country in the world per person while the Central African Republic is the poorest? Which topics do geographers study in Year 9 at Judd? In Year 9, we begin to teach some of the GCSE content alongside our own schemes of work. Topics include: \u2022 World Development: understanding why countries have developed at different rates, using statistics to measure development, explaining how countries trade with each other and suggesting how the poorest countries in the world might develop in the future. \u2022 Extreme Geography: exploring the most extreme places on Earth, from the world-record breaking physical landscapes to the extraordinary human environments and freak events which have shaped our planet. We discover what qualifies a place as \u2018extreme\u2019 and take an extreme tour of the world! \u2022 Population Change: measuring the world\u2019s population as it is now and tracking different countries as their populations rise or fall, understanding the reasons behind these changes, discovering the impacts of a population\u2019s size on countries and how governments can try to influence their population growth. \u2022 Water Resources: understanding where the world\u2019s water resources are stored and how they can be accessed, explaining why \u2018water wars\u2019 can occur between countries and where the world\u2019s worst water conflicts are now. We also consider how the world can use its water resources sustainably in the future. Which topics are included in GCSE Geography at Judd? In Years 10 and 11, students follow the Edexcel Geography A syllabus (1GA0) and the areas of study are: Year 10: Changing cities, UK Landscapes, Glaciers and glaciated uplands, Resources and energy, Coastal landscapes. Year 11: Weather hazards and climate change, Ecosystems and biodiversity, UK challenges. What other skills will I develop? Geography is an excellent subject for establishing a wide skill set which is why it is such a popular choice at GCSE, A-level and beyond. Throughout Year 9 and into the GCSE course, students continue to develop their skills of literacy and numeracy, map skills, graphical skills, ICT and GIS (Geographical Information Systems) techniques, investigative and practical skills, data interpretation and discussion. These not only enhance geographical understanding but also contribute to learning in other subject areas, which students have found to be a real advantage. Do we go on fieldwork? Yes! Fieldwork is an essential part of the Geography curriculum and covers the practical side of the course, allowing us to investigate the topics that we are studying in class in the outdoor environment. Currently, students complete two days of fieldwork in Year 10 (one in an urban environment in Hastings and the second on a beach on the south coast investigating coastal environments). We are also looking to introduce fieldwork into Year 9 for those choosing this option. How will I be taught? At Judd, the Geography Department comprises three specialist teachers (Ms Yarham, Mr Taylor and Mr Mayes). We all teach both sides of the subject (Physical and Human) and are passionate about sharing our knowledge and experience. We also encourage students to think for themselves; students bring their own ideas and observations of different places to class and that is what makes this subject so exciting. We use a range of teaching strategies which include teacher-led activities, group work, independent investigation and practical work. We also ensure that the material we teach is as up-to-date as possible. What do Judd geographers say? We asked three current Year 10 geographers for their thoughts on the course so far. They said: \u2022 \u201cI chose Geography because I enjoy Science but also found the human side of the subject really interesting. Every topic is totally different \u2013 so one week you are finding out what it\u2019s like to live in the most polluted city on earth and the next, you\u2019re learning about ice sheets and how glaciers move.\u201d \u2022 \u201cI love how current it is. What you can learn in the lesson that day might be on the news that night!\u201d \u2022 \u201cThe fieldwork is really good fun. It\u2019s great to be able to go somewhere with a research question, collect some data and then come back and analyse what you\u2019ve found. And Hastings has great ice cream!\u201d If you have any questions about the Geography course in Year 9 or at GCSE, you can talk to your teacher in lessons or come and find us in the department at any time.

For me geography is a great adventure with a purpose.\u201d- Michael Palin Geography is about asking questions. Questions like \u201cwhere is the deadliest volcano and why do people still live on its slopes?\u201d and \u201cwhy are some countries so much poorer than others and can anything be done about it?\u201d Studying Geography involves selecting and analysing information that you have been given and that you have collected yourself. It involves planning your own investigations and setting your own questions. You can expect to study topics as varied as tornadoes to tourism and global warming to glaciation. You will build on all the hard work you have put in over the last two years and have the chance to revisit some of your favourite topics. As we hope you know by now studying geography is never dull and involves responding to changes in the world around us. Every lesson you can expect to be looking at something new and the course will change to reflect current affairs. One thing you can be certain of is that if you study Geography you will go into the world a well informed and knowledgeable young adult.  What does the course involve?

  "24": "Edexcel IGCSE The Edexcel IGCSE in Geography provides an outstanding qualification that is both rigorous and fair, in term of assessment. IGCSEs are by their very nature international in outlook, but retain a local relevance. The Geography IGCSE is broad, and has a large skills base making it very a sought-after subject and course. It provides an excellent grounding in Geography for those wishing to study the subject at Pre-U Level. The Edexcel International GCSE (9\u20131) Geography qualification aims to extend students\u2019 knowledge by broadening and deepening skills. For example, students will: 1. develop and apply a holistic range of knowledge and understanding of geographical concepts and skills, including fieldwork 2. present and analyse data, draw conclusions and evaluate information from different sources 3. develop awareness of global issues and challenges and that, in moving towards a sustainable future, people have different views and attitudes to the environment. Fieldwork We undertake three fieldtrips throughout the course, and the skills for this are assessed through examinations. There is no coursework. We undertake a Rivers fieldtrip examination the course of the River Severn, an Urban fieldtrip to investigate change in Liverpool and visit a local university to discuss contemporary changes in UK Energy supply. In addition, there is an optional residential fieldtrip to Iceland for those students who take the course. This involves a trip of real geographical awe and wonder. We take students to the South West of Iceland where they travel in SuperJeeps up Eyjafjallajokull volcanoe, cave in a lava tube, visit the Soleheimajokull glacier, snorkel between two tectonics plates, visit the Blue Lagoon spa and travel to the Westman Islands, climbing Eldfell volcano. Students are invited to lectures at the School, where we host the Shropshire Branch of the Geographical Association bringing high-level academics to the Faculty. Structure There are 2 papers to the IGCSE course. The questions are a mixture of multiple-choice, short-answer, data-response and open-ended questions.

  "158": "Intent The overarching aim of the Bulmershe Geography Department is to provide a broad and balanced curriculum, which prepares students to become successful British and global citizens. In a time when so much of our political, economic and environmental decision making has a direct impact on real world places and the people and environments that share them, we need the next generation to be geographically literate. As a department we aim to develop natural curiosity, empower students to weigh up evidence surrounding some of the world\u2019s biggest dilemmas and draw conclusions. Throughout the curriculum both numeracy and literacy skills are given importance and students are encouraged to develop critical thinking skills alongside \u2018real world maths\u2019. In addition, students will gain cultural capital through a deep understanding of both their place and the lives of others from a range of places across the globe. This understanding is to be enhanced through fieldwork opportunities and a Geo Leaders Club. Thus students will emerge with a rich understanding of their place in the world with the skills needed to engage in the local labour market. The labour market profile for the south East of England highlights the need for students to have the numeracy, literacy and critical thinking skills that are required in professional occupations (Professional occupations: South East England 22%, Reading 32%, Wokingham 29%). Therefore, the curriculum is structured to enable students to gain the core skills required to enter these professions and be successful participants in 21st Century Britain. At Ks4, through the study of the Eduqas B Gography GCSE, the intent is for students to do the following:  Build on what they have studied at KS3.  Engage in the study of both Human and Physical Geography.  Continue to develop a deep understanding of their place both socially and environmentally (Reading and the UK)  Continue to develop a deep understanding of other places in the world and understand in detail the links, including benefits and weaknesses, between their place and other places around the world.  Continue to develop real world numeracy and literacy. To include the knowledge and ability to apply fundamental geographical skills of: OS Maps, data presentation, scale, maps, sketching and weather charts.  Engage in the field work process from data collection to report writing.  Progression to KS5 Implementation  Build on what they have studied at KS3 \u2013 This is achieved through the careful sequencing of topics in the KS4 curriculum. For example, student start by studying Ecosystems and Climate Change. These two topics directly build on the KS3 topics: extreme environments, global issues and weather and climate. They are also fundamental to an understanding of so many of the other topics studied later in KS4 \u2013 desertification, water resources, weather and climate and development.  Engage in the study of both Human and Physical Geography \u2013 The GCSE provides a good variety of both human and physical Geography topics. The topics have been sequenced so that students have a variety of human and physical throughout. Of course many of the topics interweave both human and physical Geography.  Continue to develop a deep understanding of their place both socially and environmentally (UK) \u2013 A sense of place is developed in many of the KS4 topics. The following topics contain a UK focus and help to expand student knowledge \u2013 Climate Change, Coasts, Rivers, Water, Urbanisation, development and weather and climate.  Continue to develop a deep understanding of other places in the world and understand in detail the links, including benefits and weaknesses, between their place and other places around the world. This is explicit in the year 11 development topic, which build nicely on the year 7 topic \u2018Geography of my stuff\u2019. However, there are a full range of other topics where student learn about far places such as the Amazon in Ecosystems and Mumbai in the Urbanisation topic.  Develop real world numeracy and literacy. To include the knowledge and ability to apply fundamental geographical skills of: OS Maps, data presentation, scale, maps, sketching and weather charts. o Reading - is implemented through the use of source material and textbooks throughout. Also through homework students are encouraged to do wider reading. In lessons Geo files are used to stretch and challenge the reading ability of the more able. o Writing \u2013 is part of every lesson and teachers focus on SPAG and the skill of extended writing \u2013 particularly in answering 8 and 12 mark questions. o Numeracy \u2013 is interwoven throughout, in year 11 numeracy questions are a key focus of lesson starters. The Fieldwork topic helps integrate all the key numeracy skills learnt,  Engage in the field work process from data collection to report writing \u2013 students complete 2 days of fieldwork and then use the six stage process of report writing in Geography to process the data collected. This is then revisited at the end of year 11 when students have the chance to complete a mock based on the field work exam \u2013 component 3.  Progression KS5 \u2013 many of the topics have direct links to KS5 topics. For example, water resources and ecosystems has a link to water and Carbon. Urbanisation has a link to contemporary urban environments. Coasts has a direct link to coasts. Urbanisation and urban and rural change are linked to changing places. Moreover, development has a direct link to global governance. The skills learnt through fieldwork and numeracy tasks are also fundamental building blocks for the KS5 investigation",

The study of Geography at GCSE, and beyond, has a direct relevance to careers such as cartography, landscape architecture, environmental consultancy and the leisure and tourism industries, but it\u2019s real importance lies in the number of basic skills it provides and it\u2019s these which pupils can then use to \u2018market\u2019 themselves. More and more people who have studied Geography now find themselves in a variety of jobs, including banking, advertising, the media, business management and the armed forces. These may not appear geographically related, but they utilize more general skills and attributes such as the collection, analysis and interpretation of data, the application of methodical working techniques, the ability to view problems from a variety of angles and some general knowledge of the world. While many other subjects cover some of these skills, Geography covers them all. Statistics have also shown that people who study  Geography are among the most employable.

For me geography is a great adventure with a purpose\u2019 Michael Palin \u2013 President of the Royal Geographical Society Geography is taught in mixed ability groups across Key Stages 3 and 4. All students are encouraged to develop their subject knowledge, to write well, to improve their ability to debate and analyse, and to think creatively when demonstrating their understanding of patterns and processes. KS4 KS5 Links Learning Journey GCSE\nGCSE Geography is a popular option for many students at Budehaven and we try to adapt the course to make it as relevant and current to the interests of our students as possible.\n\nStudents follow the  covering the units of:\n\nGeographical Skills\nOver the two years, students will be required to develop and demonstrate a range of the foundation geographical skills acquired in KS3, including cartographic, graphical, numerical and statistical skills. These skills are assessed in all three written exams, with questions based on OS maps, photographs and data manipulation.\n\n\nNatural Hazards\nStudents will examine what constitutes a hazard, and explore the causes and impacts of tectonic hazards, such as Earthquakes, as well as weather hazards such as Tropical Revolving Storms. They will undertake a case study of extreme weather in the UK, such as the Boscastle Floods, and assess how successful management strategies can be in reducing risk. The issue of Climate Change is once again revisited, this time deepening student understanding by exploring the natural causes of climate change and focussing on international mitigation efforts and adaptation.\n\nThe Living World\nEcosystems are studied at different scales from the ordinary British hedgerow to the global biome. Students will learn about the geographical characteristics of the Tropical Rainforests and the Cold Environments of the tundra and the poles. Issues related to biodiversity, deforestation and sustainable management will be explored through the TRF\u2019s and the challenge and opportunities of human activities in cold environments such as Svalbard is an assessed area of the course. The threats of economic activity in fragile areas such as cold environments is also an opportunity to develop students\u2019 evaluative thinking and essay writing skills.\nUK Landscapes\nAt Budehaven, we study Coastal and Glacial Landscapes. Our geographical location affords our students all the benefits of learning about the physical processes involved along our coastline for Coasts, as well as providing us with the opportunity to see first hand the impacts of coastal management, building on our work at KS3. As an example of a coastal management scheme in the UK to show the reasons for management, the nature of the strategy and the resulting effects and conflicts, we introduce students to Lyme Regis, a contrasting location to North Cornwall.\nUrban Issues & Challenges\nThis unit is concerned with the human processes of urbanisation and migration and how these processes change both spatially and temporally. Urban areas are studied in countries of contrasting levels of development, looking at Bristol in the UK as a higher income country (HIC) and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil as a newly emerging economy (NEE). Features of urban sustainability are a contemporary area of study, and although we focus on Curitiba in Brazil and Freiburg in Germany currently, there are increasingly more examples to explore.\nThe Changing Economic World\nThis unit holds a fascination for human geographers, examining the global variations in economic development and quality of life and the reasons behind it. Students explore ways in which the development gap can be reduced, including investment, industrial development and tourism, aid, using intermediate technology, fair trade, debt relief and microfinance loans. We study Nigeria as a newly emerging economy (NEE), an example of a country experiencing rapid economic development which leads to significant social, environmental and cultural change. This includes the study of trans-national corporations such as Nestle and Shell and their impact on development. As a contrast, the UK economy is also an area of study. Contemporary developments such as Heathrow T5, HS2 and London Crossrail are all examples of how the economy of the UK is changing and will affect employment patterns and regional growth in the future.\nThe Challenge of Resource Management\nThis is the study of the changing demand and provision of resources and the extent to which they create opportunities and challenges. We look at Water as our resource. Students will examine how conflict can result from trying to balance the rising demand for water resources against an insecure supply. There is consideration of the impacts of water insecurity, such as waterborne disease and pollution, food production and industrial output. We also explore the different strategies that can be used to increase water supply, including water transfer schemes (Lesotho) and ice stupa projects in India. How can our water supply become more sustainable?\n\n\nAssessment at GCSE\n\nThere are 3 written examinations, one Physical Geography paper, one Human Geography paper and one Fieldwork and Skills paper; there is no longer any controlled assessment component. Students will however have to complete two local field visits as a compulsory element of their course and will be examined on their findings in Paper 3.\nFieldtrips include day visits into Bude and up to Exeter, as well as a residential trip to Naples at the start of Year 11.",

  "27": "Geography is a compulsory subject at Key Stage 3, where students develop their geographical knowledge and skills within a structure of intellectual themes of diversity, change and challenges. We ask questions as varied as \u2018How can we explain the changes in polar environments?\u2019 to \u2018Should we be worried about global population growth?\u2019. This is supported with cutting-edge technology, such as GIS systems and using VR to better understand a place. All KS3 year groups get to trial geography outside the classroom, with varying day trips across the south of England.  Geography is popular at GCSE due to the range of transferable skills provided through fascinating content. Our GCSE students follow the Eduqas (A) specification, which engages students in a blend of traditional and contemporary geography. This includes new units, such as \u2018Environmental Challenges\u2019 which consider how we can and should be protecting our future world. While traditionally geography can be divided into \u2018Physical\u2019 and \u2018Human\u2019, modern geography considers how understanding the physical environment helps or hinders human interactions (and vice versa). As our world is changing so rapidly, a solid understanding of these processes will be invaluable for future generations.",

Associated Careers/Progression Choosing geography at school can open the doors to a university degree, either specifically in Geography or by combining Geography with other A Levels to gain a place on a degree programme in another subject. An A Level in Geography is recognised for being academically \u2018robust\u2019 and, most importantly, it also helps young people into the world of work. We know this is true because so many employers prize the knowledge and skills that studying Geography can provide, be it knowing how the world works, planning research and report writing, working in a team, using new technologies, communication skills, and much more. You will find geographers working in a wide range of jobs, from the City to planning, working in the environment to travel and tourism, or in international charities or retail. Studying Geography can help young people achieve careers that are professionally and financially rewarding and also enjoyable. Geographers are often employed for their wide range of literacy and numeracy skills and because they understand the \u2018big picture\u2019 of a situation, not just one view point or from one aspect. Geography means \u2018writing about the world\u2019. This shows what a diverse and interesting subject it really is.  Literacy / Numeracy Demands Students are required to develop and demonstrate a range of geographical skills, including cartographic, graphical, numerical and statistical skills, throughout their study of the specification. Skills will be assessed in all three written exams. Ordnance Survey (OS) maps or other map extracts may be used in any of the three exams. Graphical skills to: Select and construct appropriate graphs and charts to present data, using appropriate scales. This may include line charts, bar charts, pie charts, pictograms, histograms with equal class intervals, divided bar, scatter graphs, and population pyramids. Suggest an appropriate form of graphical representation for the data provided. Complete a variety of graphs and maps \u2013 choropleth, isoline, dot maps, desire lines, proportional symbols, and flow lines. Plot information on graphs when axes and scales are provided. Interpret and extract information from different types of graphs and charts. Interpret population pyramids, choropleth maps and flow-line maps. Numerical skills to: Demonstrate an understanding of number, area and scales and the quantitative relationships between units.

  "161": "The course provides coverage of physical, environmental and human aspects of the subject and the links that exist between them. The content of the specification is organised into three broad themes:  Theme 1: Changing Places - Changing Economies  Theme 2: Changing Environments  Theme 3: Environmental Challenges Key topics include urban change, development, river processes and management, coastal processes and management, extreme weather, ecosystems, climate change and desertification. An issue-based investigative approach to Geography is at the core of each of the three units. The emphasis is on problem solving as well as developing skills and increasing an understanding of topical geographical ideas.  This builds on the foundations laid at Key Stage Three. There is no tiered entry in this examination.  All our students sit the same final examinations with their final grade reflecting their own level of achievement. Assessment: Students will be assessed through three written examination papers.   The first examination will assess knowledge and understanding of the three themes outlined above. The second examination will ask students to complete a geographical problem solving exercise. The third examination will test the students understanding of the fieldwork exercises that they have completed over the course. Fieldwork Opportunities: All students will have to complete fieldwork during the GCSE course in order to answer the questions on the third examination paper. Further Education and Career Opportunities: The range of issues studied and skills developed (including ICT, working with others and numeracy) are highly appropriate for many careers.  They are especially relevant to careers in journalism, business, travel and tourism, urban and rural planning, environmental management, surveying and teaching.  Many students go on to study the subject at A Level and it combines well with both science and arts subjects.  The subject is also equally useful as a foundation for a range of vocational courses.

  "256": "The specification includes the study of a number of physical and human themes. These include changing cities, global development and resource management. The changing landscapes of the UK, weather hazards and climate change as well as ecosystems, biodiversity and management. As you study these broad themes, you will focus on the changing relationships between people and their environment which will be developed through fieldwork and tested in a synoptic paper.  Teaching and Learning Methods A wide range of teaching methods will be used during the course, including both group and individual study, using a wide range of stimulus material including maps, satellite images, photographs, a number of different text books, a large number of audio-visual aids and information technology as well as compulsory field work.   Skills and Commitment  The geography GCSE requires hard work and a positive and mature attitude. Geographers need to be able to collect and present data in a variety of forms and to be able to express themselves clearly with good presentation. They must also be able to interpret graphs, maps and photographs and to analyse data in many forms. Opportunities will exist for you to use and develop IT skills within the classwork and fieldwork.   Progression and Complementary Studies  Geography acts as a valuable bridge between the sciences and other subjects and helps pupils make sense of the world. At Campion, geography is a popular option at A level and many students have gone on to higher education in this and related subjects. Employers value geography as a subject as it provides a wide variety of valuable skills and a good understanding of the world around us. Geography tackles big issues; environmental responsibility; global interdependence; cultural understanding & tolerance; commerce; trade & industry. \u201cIf we don\u2019t understand geography, we can\u2019t properly understand the past, present or future of our planet\u201d (Michael Palin).

These subjects develop our knowledge and understanding of human behaviour and its consequences for others and the world we live in. They teach us to appreciate different cultures and beliefs and to understand the world around us. Through studying a humanities subject, you will be learning how to think creatively and critically, to reason and to ask questions, providing you with essential skills that may be applied in other subjects and in everyday life.   The humanities are traditional subjects which are held in high regard as academic disciplines and are therefore looked upon very favourably by both employers and universities.  Trips and Visits: The GCSE Geography students are required to undertake two geographical enquiries, each of which must include the use of primary data, collected as part of a fieldwork exercise. Fieldwork takes place outside of the classroom and on two separate occasions. The cost of the field trips vary depending on the distance to the location and duration of the stay (i.e. there is a small charge for fuel and any overnight stays will incur an additional cost).

What is GCSE Geography? GCSE Geography involves the study of the natural and human environments and how they interact with each other. The course considers a series of important contemporary issues including extreme weather events, hurricanes, deforestation, flood damage and flood prevention, coastal protection, urban growth and regeneration, globalization and sustainable development - to name but a few! GCSE Geography enables an understanding of these issues and promotes the need to develop sustainable responses.  Why is GCSE Geography a useful subject to take? There has never been a more important time to study Geography. Geographical issues are increasingly the topic of local, national and international debates on key issues including pollution, world poverty, immigration, globalisation, and the seemingly more common and devastating natural disasters. Having knowledge and understanding of geographical issues has become essential in modern industry, government, science and education and as a consequence, good Geographers are becoming ever more sought after. Geography at GCSE is unique in the range of transferable skills acquired by students throughout the course; these include primary and secondary data collection and interpretation, report writing, numeracy, literacy, and ICT. Consequently, Geographers can go on to study a wide range of post-16 courses. Geography is highly regarded by higher education institutions (e.g. The Russell Group of Universities) and Geographers are highly sought after by gradate employers.  Geography in Years 10 and 11 We will be following the Edexcel A specification. It contains three components: Component 1 - The Physical Environment. This includes studies of: o The changing landscapes of the UK \u2013 rocks and coasts o Weather hazards and climate change \u2013 tropical cyclones and drought o Ecosystems, biodiversity and management \u2013 tropical rainforests and deciduous woodlands in the UK. Component 2- The Human Environment. This includes studies of: o Changing cities \u2013 in the UK and around the world o Global development \u2013 the challenges facing our divided world o Resource management \u2013 energy issues and sustainability. Component 3 - Geographical Investigations: Fieldwork & UK Challenges. There are two topics: o Geographical investigations & Fieldwork - we investigate a coastal landscape and an urban environment (see below) o UK Challenges \u2013 this draws upon the rest of the course and will explore consumption and sustainability; population and economics; landscape & the UK\u2019s climate change challenges.  The balance of theory, skills and practical fieldwork makes this course highly suitable for students across a range of abilities and with diverse interests.  Fieldwork Our department is passionate about the importance of geography in today\u2019s world. We are committed to offering students the opportunity to experience real-world learning throughout their career at TBSHS. Over the course of a year, we run trips for years 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 to places as diverse as Epping Forest, the Thames Barrier, Cambridge, London, Walton-on the Naze and to Dorset, which is a residential trip at A-level. The Geography Department also periodically runs a fantastic trip to Iceland, considered to be one of the birth places of modern physical geography. Fieldwork involves human and physical data-collection, analysis and presentation, which increasingly uses GIS mapping software. Students become accomplished at evaluating and writing up research findings, all skills which make geographers highly employable!  \u2018A\u2019 Level Geography Post-GCSE Geography has changed beyond all recognition and we believe that the changes are making Geography one the most contemporary, relevant and exciting courses to take. Many of our students go on to study Geography in many forms, including Environmental Science, Oceanography and International Relations at university, including Cambridge University. We have offered a variety of extended learning opportunities in the past including visits to the Royal Geographical Society in London and video-links with UK government officials in Ghana. Please speak to members of the Geography department for more information.  How can you find out more?

  "165": "The Geography Department at LRGS There is a great tradition of studying geography at Lancaster Royal Grammar School. It is one of the most popular option subjects at GCSE with over 100 students in Year 10 and 11, and over 40 students in each year of A-level. Over recent years examination results have been excellent: in 2012 the percentage of A*/A at GCSE was 73.9% while at A-level the percentage of A/B grades was 79.4%. Many students go on to study geography or geography related subjects at university.  GCSE Geography (AQA GCSE 8035) GCSE Geography helps you to make sense of the world around you. It is up-to-date, hands on, it is relevant and it is fun. The course involves a good mix of topics from the study of natural hazards like volcanoes and tsunamis, to globalisation and the rise of China. The course will give you the chance to get to grips with some of the big questions which affect our world and understand the social, economic and physical forces and processes which shape and change our world. If you are interested in current affairs locally or globally this is the course for you. There are so many ways of learning in geography. It is very practical with opportunities to learn new skills such as: modern computer based mapping (called GIS), fieldwork skills, interpreting photographs, map skills, presenting and debating techniques and role play. Fieldwork is a really important part of geography. We go to Morecambe, Ainsdale, Lancaster and the Lake District. This provides you with a brilliant opportunity to experience some of the things you have learnt about in class, see things differently and of course have fun. At A Level, students go further afield to Iceland and possibly India. You will improve your literacy through your report writing and written work and make practical use of your numeracy skills when you interpret data and construct graphs. It is a subject that encourages you to question and find out why things happen, to make links, problem solve and form opinions. Such skills make geographers excellent decision makers who are much valued in the work place. International development, environment, marketing, transport, tourism, travel, flood protection, weather, geology, national parks, oceanography, town planning are all career areas that geographers go into alongside law, engineering, and business. What will I learn? With the emphasis on up to date, located examples, the topics that are covered at GCSE are: Natural Hazards: Tectonic and Hazards, Weather Hazards, Climate Change Ecosystems, Tropical Rainforests, Cold Environments UK Physical Landscapes: Coastal Landscapes and Glacial Landscapes Urban Issues Globally and within the UK The changing Economic World Global variations in economic development and quality of life. Closing the Global Development Gap Newly Emerging Economies UK economic changes Resource management Energy issues Geographical skills Students are required to develop and demonstrate a range of geographical skills, including cartographic, graphical, numerical and statistical skills, throughout their study of the specification. Skills will be assessed in all three written exams. Ordnance Survey (OS) maps or other map extracts may be used in any of the three exams. You will be expected to: Keep up to date with geography in the news, empathise with other people\u2019s views and consider your opinion, use and understand geographical vocabulary learn about places all over the world. Geography helps you to understand the world around you and develop critical opinions on topics that affect you.",
  "23": "Students will explore contemporary case studies in the United Kingdom, higher income countries (HICs), newly emerging economies (NEEs) and lower income countries (LICs). Topics tackled include climate change, poverty, deprivation, global shifts in economic power and the challenge of sustainable resource use. Students develop a scientific problem-solving approach to issues such as food security, global fresh-water shortage, and desertification. They are also encouraged to understand their role in society, by considering different viewpoints, values and attitudes.\u202f   In Years 10 and 11 the students follow the AQA GCSE Geography Specification. We take each of the units in the specification and encourage students to focus on challenges and opportunities presented in problematic areas, such as the favelas in Rio or the Thar Desert. We also encourage them to isolate problems and suggest solutions to issues such as global food security and water shortages.\u202f  Students will be required to take part in a field study for both Physical and Human Geography which will form the basis for Paper 3: Geographical Applications. Field studies examine coastal processes and urban development and usually take place in North Norfolk. In addition, students may have the opportunity to take part in an extra-curricular trip to Innsbruck, Austria to study glaciation, but this is not compulsory.\u202f\u202f   Students are taught for 3 x 50-minute sessions a week. Year 10 begins by addressing Urban Issues and Challenges, focusing on Rio De Janeiro in Brazil, and Bristol in the UK. We then move on to The Living World looking at biomes under threat, focusing on tropical rainforests and examining reasons for the worldwide expansion of deserts. Next, we study the challenge of Resource Management, specialising in the causes and consequences of diminishing global freshwater supply. Here we focus on water transfer schemes in Lesotho and India. At the end of the first year, we switch back to physical Geography and examine the causes and consequences of coastal erosion in Physical Landscapes. As part of this section of the course we will develop fieldwork skills and apply them during a trip to the Norfolk coast.    The Year 11 Autumn Term begins with the challenge of Natural Hazards focusing on Tropical Storms and Earthquakes in Japan and the USA. We follow this with a close look at the role of Trans National Companies (TNCs) and the rise of post-industrial economies in The Changing Economic World.

  "124": "The world in which we live is likely to change more in the next 50 years than it has ever done before.  Geography explains why and helps us to prepare for these changes.  This exciting course is based on a balanced framework of physical and human geography. It allows students to investigate the delicate links between the natural and human world, and approach and examine the battles between the man-made and natural worlds. Style of learning The course will involve the discovery of information, consideration of problems, an understanding of why things happen, problem-solving and an evaluation of solutions.  A variety of teaching and learning approaches will be taken such as essay writing, decision making exercises, videos, presentations, fieldwork, computer work and discussions. Teaching techniques will lay stress on the development of useful skills (observation, the collection, representation, interpretation and use of data) partly through practical work, including investigations in the field; consequently, some of the course will take place away from the school premises and will include group and individual work. Use of ICT will be integral to the study of the course.  Students will travel the world from their classroom, exploring case studies in the United Kingdom (UK), higher income countries (HICs), newly emerging economies (NEEs) and lower income countries (LICs). Topics of study include climate change, poverty, deprivation, global shifts in economic power and the challenge of sustainable resource use. Students are also encouraged to understand their role in society, by considering different viewpoints, values and attitudes.   Progression Geography is a very well respected discipline within higher education institutes and workplaces due to the variety of skills that it offers and the fact that geography offers the chance to learn about and combine both science and the arts. Students can progress onto AS and A2 Geography, following the A Level syllabus that is the continuation of the GCSE syllabus. In 2015 The Guardian identified geography as the 'must-have A Level. It is recognised by the Russell Group of Universities as a very desirable A-Level.In addition, geographers have been known to venture into the world of management and administration, medicine and veterinary medicine, finance and retail.",
  "254": "What will I study?  Unit 1 \u2013 Living with the Physical Environment. You will begin with in-depth studies of a range of natural hazards including: earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes, extreme weather in the UK, and climate change. The next section focuses on the formation of rivers and coasts and how we can manage issues that are faced by people who live near them. Finally we study two dynamic ecosystems \u2013 tropical rainforests and hot deserts.   Unit 2 \u2013 Challenges in the Human Environment. We begin this unit with a focus on how rising population is causing urbanisation and affecting cities. We will learn about the different challenges faced by cities in the rich and poor world and then consider how sustainability could be achieved. There is a study of development and recent economic changes across the world and in the UK. The module ends with a look at the global inequality of resources including water and energy with a closer look at food supply.   Unit 3 \u2013 Geographical Applications. This is a brand new exam and replaces the need for submission of a written piece of fieldwork. On visits to Liverpool and the Peak District, students will collect data on human and physical aspects of Geography. Questions in the exam will assess their understanding of this process and of the ways they have analysed their findings. This unit also contains an issue evaluation section, for which pre-release information will be studied in class. Students answers in this section will demonstrate the skills they have learnt, such as their ability to comment on photographs, use statistics, and evaluate the effectiveness of graphs.   What can this course lead onto?  Pretty much anything. Skills learnt in Geography span across English, Maths and the Sciences and you will also become proficient in practical investigations and problem solving. Choosing Geography allows you to keep your options open for the future. Our A-level Geographers have gone into such varied fields as: Architecture, Journalism, Banking, Law, Dentistry, Engineering, Marketing and Scientific research. Careers more specific to the course include: Pollution Consultancy, Surveying and Transport Planning.   Key Points  \u2022 Brand new curriculum  \u2022 Appeals to universities and employers  \u2022 Exciting fieldwork opportunities - students on the Geography course must attend all trips  What can I study at Parrs Wood Sixth Form?  Pupils can continue with Geography A Level but can also progress on to a wide variety of qualifications including other Humanities subjects e.g. Law and Politics, Town Planning, Surveying, Geology.",
