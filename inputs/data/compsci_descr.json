It aims to develop students\u2019 knowledge of computer technology and their ability to understand and apply computational thinking strategies in analysing and solving computing problems. It develops logical reasoning, critical thinking, analytical skills and creativity. At the end of KS4 our students will be ready for A level studies in Computer Science and for entry into apprenticeship and training positions in Computing. Meeting our local need: Bulmershe School is lucky to be situated close to the Thames Valley Park, the \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d of the United Kingdom. As a department, we have a good link with Oracle Technology and Microsoft Inc., both with office complexes at Thames Valley Park. Our students have opportunities for learning and work experience at computing companies in Thames Valley Park. It is our aim to build and expand these relationships for the benefit of our students. Our links with local companies affords students the opportunity to see a clear link between our courses and careers. In particular, the Kids Who Code program of Oracle Technology has been beneficial in encouraging greater enrolment of our students (especially girls) in Computer Science. Implementation Our KS4 Computer Science course teaches students the fundamentals of Computing and programming. Units of work include:  Fundamentals and mechanisms of algorithms, including searching and sorting algorithms  Data types and data structure  Binary, decimal and hexadecimal numbers and data representation  Functions and types of software  Computer architecture  Computer networks  Cyber security  Programming in Python Our KS4 Computer Science is delivered from year 10 through to year 11. In year 10, students do two hours of Python programming every fortnight for the entire year. This gives us the opportunity to teach the concepts, mainly through experimentation and guided discovery, and gives the students enough time to consolidate their learning by applying the skills learned in solving problems under various scenarios. The students complete at least one past GCSE programming project. By the end of year 10, the students become fully ready to learn the fundamentals and mechanisms of algorithms in year 11. In year 10 too, students spend three hours every fortnight learning about computer architecture, networks, logic and languages, data representation and systems software. In year 11, in addition to the algorithms unit of work, students complete their mandatory GCSE programming project and the remaining theory contents of the OCR Computer Science syllabus; culminating in carefully planned revision lessons. Our revision regime is rigorous, requiring students to study and revise both at home and in lesson, completing mastery learning worksheets and past papers and reviewing their work. Adaptability to Online Learning Our KS4 Computer Science lessons are fully teachable online, requiring no additional software or hardware beside a Windows OS computer, laptop or tablet that has Google Chrome installed on it. Our KS4 curriculum adopts a learning-by-doing approach in the sense that we spend less than 30% of lesson time on teacher-student interaction and a minimum of 70% on students producing work. The work students do enable them to discover knowledge for themselves, consolidate their learning and achieve a sense of fulfilment in their learning. Ensuring that students spend a minimum of 70% of their lesson time in producing work maintains their attention and engagement, whether they are in a classroom or at home. Students do not need to buy proprietary software for our KS4 Computer Science lessons to work from home. We only use free and trusted software in addition to apps that come with our Google subscription. For example, we use IDLE, a free and trusted software, for all our programming lessons. From year 10 through year 11, students can open their work in Google apps such as docs, sheets and slides. Impact At KS4, our students enjoy learning, develop the right learning habits, progressively become drivers of their own learning agendas and achieve excellent results in terms of academic success.

  "23": "We aim to develop the knowledge and skills required for our students to play an active role in the digital world that surrounds them. Developing a firm grasp of computing concepts will help them get the best from the systems they use, solve problems when they go wrong and develop new systems when they are required.    We believe all students will find it empowering to study a combination of computational thinking, computing principles and a computational approach to problem-solving. The ability to focus this combination of academic and practical skills on a problem will help bring success in all curriculum subjects and the CAST challenge projects.   There can sometimes be confusion about the differences between IT and Computer Science. Computer Science refers to the processes used to create usable computer programmes and applications together with all the theory behind those processes. Information Technology, on the other hand, refers to the application of computer programmes to solve problems.   Computing in industry is essentially a practical subject which applies theory to design and develop products for clients. With this in mind, we have developed our curriculum to reflect modern business practice. Most learning is delivered through projects, which involve project management, teamwork, report writing and the use of industry standard tools.         Content  In Year 10 and 11 students follow the OCR Computer Science Specification. The course aims to develop students' understanding and practical application of computational thinking, problem-solving and theoretical knowledge of Computer Science.   This course material covers 11 taught sections over two components:    Component 1:Systems Architecture  Memory & Storage  Computer Networks, connections and protocols  Network Security  Systems Software  Ethical, legal, cultural and environmental impacts of digital technology  Component 2:  Algorithms  Programming fundamentals (using VB.net and SQL)  Producing robust programs  Boolean logic  Programming languages and Integrated Development Environments Each component is assessed with a 1hr 30minute written paper.  Year 10  Autumn Term - develop understanding of algorithms and programming using Visual Basic, covering: variables, arrays, selection, subroutines/functions, for and while loops. They will work through a variety of projects including: a grade calculator; a programme using functions to calculate the area of different shapes; and a traffic light simulation. Students finish the term by using their new skills to design and develop a Dungeons and Dragons game.   Spring Term - start with several new programming constructs: string manipulation, random numbers, records and 2-dimensional arrays.  We also broaden the focus of the course to include machine architecture, Boolean algebra and logic circuits. Students design and develop a 'Computer versus Human' battleships game.   Summer Term - students will complete projects which will provide them with the practical programming skills they will need for these exams and for further study of Computer Science. The projects include creating a garden design budget calculator and an encryption project. Also, we will start to focus on the theoretical aspects of the course, which will cover machine code, search and sort algorithms.   Year 11  We start with a recap of the coding constructs students have learnt in Year 10. Students will then begin learning the remaining theory needed for the course whilst building on their programming skills.  It is important that students understand the context for applying the theory they are learning. With this in mind, we have developed projects and tasks that allow our learners to see how Computer Science affects the wider world:  Networking and network security.  Students are given a plan for a two-story building and asked to design a secure physical network suitable for a Computer Science company.  They will cover network topologies, protocols, and security.  Extending project 1. Students focus on the protocols need to run a network by developing an interactive presentation covering TCP/IP.  In the Spring term students design a series of public information posters that cover aspects of cyber security, including social engineering, malware, ethical hacking. The final task of the year is to research and create a presentation that explains the ethical, legal and environmental responsibilities that Computer Scientists have in the modern world.",

They can allow the teacher to identify gaps in students learning which will also aid with planning. They can also be used a comparable form of assessment across classes. Examples are the KS3 Quick Quizzes; KS3 end of topic tests; KS4 Kahoot Quizzes for GCSE; KS4 MCQ.  Starter Memory re-call quick quizzing is used most lessons to support recall of key terms and processes.  KNOWLEDGE ACCESS Vocabulary Exposition In computing many tier 3 words have clear and obvious etymological links e.g. Binary. We strive to teach the etymology of words in lessons to enable students to not only remember the keywords but apply them in the correct context especially with word families from the same root word. The Knowledge Organisers for Computing outline the key tier 3 vocabulary and there are regular opportunities to refer to these resources including quizzing, already mentioned. Tier 2 words are broached as they arise and the teacher notices students having difficulty in understanding the texts being read. Reading Instruction   Texts in Computing can be technically diverse and challenging.  Most activities are supported with texts appropriate to them but help is often need to decode and understand the more challenging terms.  The KOs support this along with teachers reading out loud and leading reading episodes in class.   Writing Instruction Online assignments allow students to practice and improve their subject specific writing and use of key knowledge.  These assignments have scaffolding so that all can achieve their potential.  Written work comes in the form of practice questions, extended writing via research and digital product design as we feel it is important for students to understand how the written word should be presented when dealing with digital mediums.  STUDENT FOCUS Allowing students to work together constructively to solve problems in the KS4 Pair Programming and Kodu Test and Play components of the curriculum, for example, supports and extends learning. Students are given dedicated improvement time to act and reply to feedback to improve their work and understanding. For parts of the curriculum in Computing an enquiry-based approach is adopted through a flipped classroom when appropriate.

Stephen Hawking  We aim to provide our students with a rounded education so they are fully equipped to excel in a world in which computational thinking and creativity coupled with ICT skills are increasingly impacting on all aspects of our lives. We aim to ensure that every student has the understanding, awareness and skills to safely, enjoyably and effectively utilise digital tools and devices today and into the future  We aim to: Provide enjoyable and challenging lessons that promote a love of Computer Science and foster a desire to learn more Enrich and extend students as both independent and collaborative learners Encourage the flexibility and openness of mind necessary to adjust to, and take advantage of, advances in technology, whilst understanding the moral, social and ethical implications and consequences for both individuals and society Ensure all students are aware of the dangers as well as the opportunities ICT & Computer Science affords and consequently adopt sensible e-safety practices  KS4 (GCSE in years 10 & 11)  GCSE Computer Science is taught in 5 lessons a fortnight with each lesson lasting 50 minutes.  GCSE Computer Science is an optional subject for students in KS4 and students study the AQA Computer Science GCSE 8520. This is assessed through two examinations (both are 90 minutes long at the end of year 11) worth 50% each. Students also have to compete a practical programming project undertaken over 20 hours during year 10 and year 11 using the programming language Python 3.  For those starting their GCSE course in Year 10 of September 2020 onwards the structure of assessment is being changed and we are currently awaiting details from the examination boards on what these changes will be.  All KS4 students use Python 3 which is available to download for free from www.python.org  \u2013 where it is possible to do so, students find it very helpful to have Python 3 installed on a computer at home.  How can parents help? Parents should not feel under pressure to provide any specific hardware/software as there is provision at lunchtime to meet pupils\u2019 needs. However, some homework will require internet access and access to a PC, therefore, if this not available at home, students will have to complete such homework at lunchtime. If students have access to a computer to complete homework then having access to office applications is very useful. In school we currently use Microsoft Office 2013 but this is compatible with a range of office software so the version available at home need not be the same. There are also some free to download open source office suites available on the internet. All students have their own school Google account which gives them access to Google docs which can be used for individual and collaborative work both at school and home as long as internet access is available. This allows students to work on tasks without parents needing to purchase or download any new software. Students all learn computer programming and having software on a computer at home which they can practice on is particularly useful: Scratch is used in years 7 and is available to use online at http://scratch.mit.edu/ Python 3 is used in years 8 to 13 and is available to download for free from python.org Make sure to download a version of Python 3 such as Python 3.7.5 (not Python 2) as we use Python 3 in school. All students have access to Moodle, our VLE and if internet access is available at home they should be encouraged to use Moodle to access work and additional resources provided by the teacher. Students undertaking examination courses in KS4 and KS5 have a course text book but a wide range of additional electronic resources are available to help them via their Computer Science Moodle course \u2013 students use these resources in lessons and should be encouraged to use them regularly at home as well. Some of the resources can be downloaded onto computers at home whereas others require access to the internet whilst they are being used. All students have their own school Google account which gives them a school email account which should be used for all school related email communication \u2013 students should not be using personal email accounts in school Where next: The purpose of the current Computer Science provision is to provide a sound basis in both computer literacy and application of ICT to practical situations. This should give students enough grounding to function effectively in the modern day workplace, and to be able to take their studies further should they wish to undertake a degree or follow a specific career in Computer Science. The applications of Computer Science are enormous, and cover just about every aspect of modern day life both in and out of the workplace.  Most of us now carry a small but powerful computer with us wherever we go (our mobile phone) and also rely on computer systems without thinking about it when going about our everyday lives whether it be\u2026 Using the checkout system at the supermarket (a computer system) Relaxing in front of our digital tv (a computer system) Using an ATM to withdraw money from the bank (a computer system) Having an MRI scan at hospital (a computer system) Following directions on our SatNav (a computer system) \u2026the list goes on and on Understanding more about how these computer systems work and learning to write programs to use and control them is thus clearly beneficial.  However, studying Computer Science is more than this, in particular it develops a range of transferrable skills including problem-solving, critical thinking and analysis.  These are skills needed in many careers including engineering, science, medicine, financial and resource management careers. Opportunities out of lessons:  There are currently 5 computer suites, which are variously available for students to use at lunchtime to complete work.  All students have access to Moodle, our VLE and if internet access is available at home they should be encouraged to use Moodle to access work and additional resources provided by the teacher.  All students have their own school Google account which gives them a school email account which should be used for all school related email communication \u2013 students should not be using personal email accounts in school. The Google account also gives access to Google docs which can be used for individual and collaborative work.  We run a Computer Science lunchtime club providing a range of opportunities beyond the curriculum including the chance to extend programming skills beyond the time available in timetabled lessons.  Curriculum  Our schemes of learning are designed to provide a broad and balanced curriculum that enables all students to develop into increasingly independent and discerning learners, creators and users of digital systems and content. We aim to offer a Computer Science education that equips all students to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world thus our schemes of learning both challenge and support students to promote high achievement for all of them in relation to their ability.  We want our students to gain not only a high level of skills but also the understanding to be able to transfer these skills effectively into all aspects of their lives.",

Computers are an undeniable part of our world now; it is unlikely that you won\u2019t come across a computer daily if not hourly. Smartphones, tablets and the internet have changed the way we communicate, work, socialise and innovate. With this being the case it is more and more important that you are prepared for this world by having an understanding how these devices have changed our world and how you can utilise them and more importantly so that you can program them so that you can access the emerging jobs that will appear over the next decade and beyond. What does it involve? Unit 1 covers five areas: Data (including binary and hexadecimal representation and mathematics) Computational thinking (algorithms \u2013 following, constructing and amending. Truth tables) Computers (hardware, components and software. Characteristics of programming languages) Networks (Understanding networks and network security) Issues and impact (emerging trends in computing. Ethical, legal issues). This paper consists of five compulsory questions, each one focused on one of the topic areas. The questions consist of multiple-choice, short-, medium- and extendedopen-response, tabular and diagrammatic items. What about coursework Unit 2 is a practical assessment. This is done as a two-hour examination rather than a piece of coursework. It covers how algorithms are used in relation to programs. Ability to read, write, refine and evaluate programs written in python will be tested. What skills and experience do I need? In terms of experience \u2013 none. We will teach you all you need to be able to program (though commitment outside lesson time to practice your skills will be needed if you want to do well). The first skill you need is maths \u2013 not at a high level \u2013 but the first topic is binary \u2013 which is not difficult really \u2013 but you need a bit of confidence in your maths so that you will be able to cope with it.

  "233": "Introduction The change from ICT to computing made the subject much more technical and has moved the emphasis from how to use popular software applications to how computers actually work and how to develop logical thought processes. One classic analogy is that ICT is like learning to drive a car, whereas computer science is learning how to design a car, maintain it and ultimately to be able to drive it better. There has been much publicity recently about the need for greater technical knowledge of computers and a massive demand for computing skills. There has traditionally been a significant gender imbalance in the subject, something that we have been working hard to address. Camp Hill had been offering an AS Level Computer Science qualification in Year 10 and 11 for many years, but now there is an established GCSE course in place we have returned to offering a more conventional GCSE option. The Course A significant part of the total lesson time will be spent developing programming skills in different ways including: - a high level language (Python) - a low level language (using the Little Man Computer simulator) Regular practice of programming through set tasks will be essential and will enable you to get computers to do what you want as well as developing structured approaches to problem solving. It is important to develop these skills throughout the course. The theory topics studied include: - Computer architecture (how the insides of a computer work) \u2013 covering both hardware and system software (i.e. what do Windows/iOS/Android actually do?) - The laws that surround the use of computers (for example the downloading of songs over the Internet) - How networks work, and how can we help them to work better? - Cybersecurity threats and how they can be avoided - Some maths work (Binary, Boolean algebra, etc.) - The impact computers have had, and may have in the future - How some common problems have actually been solved using computers We are keen to encourage extra-curricular computing work, so support various competitions and other opportunities throughout the course. Success requires a genuine interest in the subject, and you will be expected to actively contribute in lessons, bringing your own ideas and experiences and not just reading from text books. As a rough guide, those who are likely to be suited to computer science often have skills that also make them good at maths, physics or languages and you may enjoy problem solving or have an interest in how things work. Assessment Originally all GCSE Computer Science courses included 20% NEA (\u2018Non Examined Assessment\u2019 = coursework). The revised J277 qualification introduced in September 2020 removes this component. Assessment is therefore based on two 90 minute exams, each 50% of the total GCSE grade: - Component 01: Computer systems Introduces students to the central processing unit (CPU), computer memory and storage, data representation wired and wireless networks, network topologies, system security and system software. It also looks at ethical, legal, cultural and environmental concerns associated with computer science. - Component 02: Computational thinking, algorithms and programming  Students apply knowledge and understanding gained in component 01. They develop skills and understanding in computational thinking: algorithms, programming techniques, producing robust programs, computational logic and translators Careers and Higher Education There is the possibility for you to continue on to A Level Computer Science in the Sixth Form. A level also includes an independent programming project, which is another reason why it is important for you to develop these skills in practical settings. If you want to increase your knowledge in the subject further you may consider computer science as a degree choice. Ultimately there is a wide range of careers available in computer science, many of them commanding very high salaries. Unlike many other career directions this situation is unlikely to change. Degree level study is available in an ever increasing number of areas such as Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence or Robotics, as well as overlapping with other fields such as Languages, Philosophy, Medicine, Sports Science, Psychology, etc. By studying computer science you will develop logical thinking skills and a systematic approach to problem solving. By having a better understanding of how computers and programs work, you will be in an excellent position to adopt and adapt to the latest technology in whatever field you work. Mr N.

Our curriculum is designed and delivered in order to work towards achieving this aim. By the end of their journey through Dixons Unity Academy, a student of computing will:  At the end of years 7 and 8 students will have been exposed to the following: programming in code and block based languages, E-Safety, presentation, spreadsheet, hardware and software, web design, data representation and control systems. Students will therefore become responsible, competent, confident and creative users of information and communication technology.  At key stage 3 they will have experienced; understanding of key algorithms that reflect computational thinking; programming languages to solve computational problems; understand simple Boolean logic; understand the hardware and software components that make up computer systems; understand how instructions are stored and executed within a computer system; undertake creative projects that involve selecting, using, and combining multiple applications and understand a range of ways to use technology safely, respectfully, responsibly and securely.  Those students studying Creative iMedia will develop a wide range of knowledge and skills to work in the creative media sector. This includes transferable skills such as research, planning and review and working with others.  Overall students will be able to understand pre-production skills used in the creative and digital media sector. They will develop their understanding of the client brief, time frames, deadlines and preparation techniques that form part of the planning and creation process. Students will also understand the purpose and properties of digital graphics, and know where and how they are used. They will be able to plan the creation of digital graphics, create new digital graphics using a range of editing techniques and review a completed graphic against a specific brief. Students will also be able to explore and understand the different properties, purposes and features of multipage websites, plan and create a multipage website and review the final website against a specific brief. Finally, they will understand the purpose and properties of interactive multimedia products, be able to plan and create an interactive multimedia product to a client\u2019s requirements and review it, identifying areas for improvement. Our uniting sentence is: We provided students with a curriculum that developed a wide range of computing skills and developed an appreciation of the creative media sector, in order to contribute effectively in this fast and ever growing exciting digital sector. In order to truly appreciate the subject and develop a deep schema, computing has been sequenced with the following rationale:  At key stage 3 students are taught content that they can then embed in Key stage 4. They are therefore given a hands on approach in undertaking the above topics.  At key stage 3, students work through learning diaries, which are designed for students to follow a sequence of lessons, feedback on what they have learnt and complete spacing and retrieval practice to ensure knowledge is embedded.  At key stage 4 there is a practical approach to the units covered where students are taught how to use basic and advanced tools to create a variety of products to a high standard.  Within the Creative iMedia qualification, students complete four units of work, three of which involve completing a variety of products (a digital graphic, a multimedia product and a multipage website) and assessment is through assignment brief completion. The fourth unit is an external exam, which focuses on pre-production skills where students develop their understanding of the client brief, timeframes, deadlines and preparation techniques that form part of the creation and planning process.  There will be opportunities for retrieval practice and exploration activities to allow students to develop their skills in preparation for their formal assessment in the form of assignments. We also use spaced practice in developing the skills to the exam component and preparing for answering exam questions. These components use Level one / two Pass, Merit and Distinction grading criteria.  Creative iMedia is a vocational subject, which therefore means through the majority of the time, it provides students with the opportunity to demonstrate their skills in assignment based tasks, rather than the traditional preparation for examinations as would be with GCSE subjects. The course does have one examination element, which is completed in year 11. Our Computing curriculum addresses Social Disadvantage through:  Students are provided with access to computing facilities and a range of software that they otherwise may not be able to access.  When completing Creative iMedia, we have weekly after school intervention sessions where we can focus on key areas whilst giving one-to-one help.  We ensure that intervention is proactive and data driven, on a regular basis staff address the gaps identified from in-class or cycle assessment data in order to offer provision to eradicate these differences. We use intervention folders in classrooms, which are used on a daily basis, which identifies the disadvantaged students (and SEND / PP) and then where a weekly plan is used to ensure intervention is taking place to help students progress.  Revision guides are provided for students to use. We also use previous exam questions as spacing and retrieval practice in Learn Nows and as homeworks.  In regards to KS3, students are provided with learning diaries for each area taught and spacing and retrieval practice of homework and DIRT feedback is completed in these diaries. Our curriculum in Computing / Creative iMedia supports the personal development of students by:  In KS3 the project completed on e-safety provides students with the opportunity to focus on how to stay safe online.  The completion of work in the units studied in Creative iMedia encourage independent working in completing their assignments, creativity in the planning and design of their products (e.g. multipage website / digital graphic) and awareness of the digital media sector.  Studying Creative iMedia equips students with a range of creative media skills and provides the opportunities to develop transferable skills such as research, planning and reviewing what they have completed. Our belief is that homework should consist of purposeful and deliberate practice and interleaved revision of what is taught in lessons. This knowledge is secured and applied through metacognitive quizzing and low-stakes tests Opportunities are built in to the curriculum to make links to the world of work in support of our careers advice and guidance that all students receive:  Digital Media plays an important part in many areas of our everyday lives and is an important part of the UK economy. There is a demand from employers for an increasingly skilled and technically literate workforce as more and more media products are produced digitally. Creative iMedia provide students with specific and transferable skills and a solid foundation in understanding and applying this subject.  Creative iMedia students are provided with essential knowledge, transferable skills and tools to improve their learning in other subjects with the aims of enhancing their employability when they leave education, contributing to their personal development and future economic well-being.  Creative iMedia students will be able to see how completing this course develops their skills to focus on possible future careers such as a games designer, graphic designers and web development.  Completing this course can also provide students with the opportunity to further their education into A Levels or apprenticeships. Opportunities to build an understanding of the social, moral, spiritual and ethical issues are explored through:  In years 7 and 8 students get the opportunity to discuss personal and online safety in depth during e-safety learning.  In years 9-11 there are a range of units which makes the students explore areas such as plagiarism and copyright design and patents act with other legislation as it applies to the use of ICT in creative media, e.g. the computer misuse act and data protection.  We also look at how creative media can affect the quality of life experienced by people with disabilities and the responsibility to meet individuals\u2019 access requirements.  Creative iMedia also helps students to appreciate that creative media contributes to the development of our culture and to our highly technological future. It also focuses on showing students that they need to show cultural awareness of their audience when communicating with creative media, this involves focusing on who their client is in the client brief when designing and producing the product required, taking their needs into account. The Computing / Creative iMedia curriculum is designed to explore cultural domains that go beyond the specification, yet also effectively prepare students for success in their GCSE examinations:  At key stage 3, students learn many IT skills (e.g. spreadsheets and presentations) which can be transferred into many other subjects. These practical transferable skills students master such as self-reflection, communication, teamwork and problem solving will also support their progress in the present and the future.  Creative iMedia provides students with the opportunities to develop useful transferable skills such as research, planning, and review, working with others and communicating creative concepts effectively.  At key stage 4, students will have the opportunity to learn about how the changes in working practices due to the use of ICT in creative media have impacted upon the environment e.g. fewer carbon emissions due to more online/remote working and therefore less travel and environmental issues connected to the production, and disposal of ICT resources used in creative media.  At key stage 4, students will also explore the effect on natural resources in the creation and of ICT systems used in creative media including the environmental impact of digital devices and their use.",

  "73": "We want Pupils to be able to code the next Facebook or Xbox blockbuster, to found the next Pixar or Wikipedia, to publish a magazine, to make a film, to connect with others around the world, to use all the wonderful new tools to unleash your creativity and hack a better future for all of us! The IT department wants every child to be able to do three things by the time they leave. Students should understand:  how to build computational tools,  how to use those tools effectively and  how to use those tools responsibly. To that end we have divided the curriculum into three strands, each being taught in a different term. These strands are:  Computational Thinking  Working Life  Connected World   This is where you roll your sleeves up and play around with how things work. You\u2019ll open up a computer and look inside. You\u2019ll begin to see how code works, how it turns electricity into ones and zeroes into MMRPGs, how important hacking is and more. Many people still think it\u2019s magic. You\u2019ll be a wizard to them. Like Merlin, just without the beard. Computational thinking is fundamental to computer science. It is a particular type of approach to problem-solving that usually (though not always) finds expression in software. It is an academic discipline in itself and has plenty of cross-curricular \u201coomph\u201d especially with maths and sciences. In Google\u2019s words, it \u201cinvolves a set of problem solving skills and techniques that software engineers use to write programs that underlie the computer applications you use\u201d. There are essentially four such skills: abstraction (generalising about the qualities of a problem), decomposition (breaking down complex problems into smaller ones), algorithms (sequencing instructions) and pattern-spotting. Rather than teach these theoretically, each student becomes familiar through a range of different programming projects, be it robotics or writing a game for an Xbox. To make computational thinking as tangible as possible, every student will have repeated opportunities to design, write, run, and debug, executable programs.   Want to start your own company? Maybe you want to make your own film? Or perhaps you want to gather some data to help you cure malaria? Not yet? Too young? Maybe you just have a history essay due in and you want to make your teacher spit out their digestive biscuit in surprise at the amazing facts you\u2019ve found? Chances are a computer can help. This is where we show you how. The Computing curriculum has recently been changed. The changes have moved towards computer studies, programming and coding. We do, though, need students to understand how to use these tools, both for their own projects, for other subjects and for later life. As per the computer science, we aim to do that by making use of real-world projects and data wherever possible. To that end, students learn how:  to use spreadsheets by using them to analyse census data to see how their neighbourhoods compare to others  to use search engines by using them to discover and evaluate different sources for use in their own research  to use presentation software by using them for Kids Dig, an event where the children take over the teaching of lessons for half a day.  There is a common assumption that children are \u201cdigital natives\u201d. In effect, so the thinking goes, because children have been born into a connected world they understand the rules for working in it better than their adults. It is a dangerous assumption. While, yes, adults still might be working out how best to operate in a connected world and making very visible mistakes, digital citizenship needs both new world technology and old world values. This strand of the curriculum helps children learn two things. First, we look at how to navigate life online safely and responsibly through looking at topics such as cyber safety and identity theft. Second we look at how to become a proactive \u201cforce for the good\u201d online, through looking at the Wisdom of Crowds, privacy issues and how to amplify positive behavioural norms in online forums or social networks.
